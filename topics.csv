RUSSIA SYRIA,"https://www.epochtimes.de/politik/welt/afd-abgeordnete-zurueck-von-syrien-reise-freunde-es-geht-warum-ist-kein-botschafter-dort-a2379011.html:  After returning from their trip to Syria AfD politicians have described their impressions of the civil war country. A first impression was already published on March 7: AfDler in Syria: ""Women sit in bars and wear jeans instead of burka - in Mecca and Berlin-Neukölln barely imaginable."" The six politicians have now come to the conclusion that Syria as a safe According to the North Rhine-Westphalian Member of Parliament Christian Blex in Berlin on Monday. Jürgen Pohl, who was on the trip, points out in an interview with the MDR that Syria wants to rebuild its own country and asks the other states It was also explicitly pointed out that desertional young men can return and fall under amnesty. Mr. Pohl explains: ""You can not just sit here and say we do not do anything. Because the situation on the ground is such that there are actually only in some places disputes. ""The AfD now wants the federal government to communicate their results of the trip and put pressure, Jürgen Pohl says: Video: The MDR spoke to the deputy of the AfD , Jürgen PohlThe video also commented on how the trip was organized, with the AFD asking in the Syrian Embassy of Russia and experiencing that it was very easy to organize the trip. They were in Aleppo, Homs, Damascus and saw the will of the people Reconstruction.Jürgen Pohl declares that he has not promoted exchange with opposition groups on the spot or abroad. They talked to a lot of groups, especially the UNHCR does a good job - where they give lessons, for example. The Red Crescent also provided good help. It was ""undisputed that there are still fighting zones in Syria"". The group also saw areas that were not destroyed at all. Syria says it does not want or want to put an end to international terrorism. Violent offenders from more than 100 states were identified on site, explains Jürgen Pohl. Six years of war were enough. The AfD politicians wanted to inform themselves with their journey on their own information about the possibilities for a return of Syrian refugees in their war-ravaged homeland. AfD foreign affairs minister Armin-Paulus Hampel suggested that the federal government or the EU could ""financially"" influence Damascus. He said: ""I have no information about reports that there have been chemical weapons operations by the Syrian government. ""The group of politicians met, among others, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim and Minister of National Reconciliation Ali Haidar. They also met with Grand Mufti Ahmed Hassun and Deputy Patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church. Many of their interlocutors had expressed the express wish that those from Syria Syrians Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem called on all Syrian refugees to return home in 2017.

But on the people of the city of Afrin, in north-western Syria, Turkey's invasion on Sunday must have been like the appearance of an occupying power. Turkish soldiers hoisted the flag of their country over buildings of the administration. Their allies from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) plundered food, electrical appliances, motorcycles, goats, set fire to shops selling alcohol. Fighters drove forward with bulldozers and tore the statue of blacksmith Kawa, a Kurdish legend figure, from the pedestal. For Erdogan the conquest of Afrin means a military success. His army marched into the province of Afrin on January 20 to fight the Kurdish militia YPG. Piece by piece, the soldiers had moved from the border to the center of the province. Since the beginning of last week, they besieged the city of Afrin. Observers had forecast weeks, possibly months, of battles. Ultimately, however, the YPG retreated, with almost no resistance. ""The terrorists ran away with their tails tucked in,"" Erdogan mocked. Turkey has also defeated the world powers USA and Russia in Afrin, added one of its advisors. Government-run Turkish newspapers wrote on Monday about a ""Victory Day"" and a ""Day of Pride."" ""We wrote history in Afrin."" And even opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu spoke of a ""heroic battle"". ""Human lives count nothing"" For the majority of people in Afrin, however, the fall of their hometown is a disaster. Afrin was one of the few regions in Syria that had been largely spared the horror of the civil war so far. Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens, Yazidis found refuge here and lived side by side in a largely peaceful way. Tens of thousands are now on the run. People have to watch their homes being looted and do not know when and under what circumstances they can return. ""Here in Syria everyone has their own war,"" said a resident of Afrin Der Spiegel. ""Human lives count for nothing."" Erdogan is likely to feel affirmed in his war policy by defeating the YPG in Afrin. He sees the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdish terrorist organization PKK and has already announced that they want to pursue the militia to the border with Iraq. His government is currently negotiating with the US for a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from Manbij, a city east of Afrin. Turkish soldiers in Afrin respond to a journalist's question about their goals: ""Manbij, Aleppo, Kandil"" (PKK Headquarters). In the medium term, however, the military could take revenge on Turkey. Although Erdogan is self-confident: ""In the center of Afrin now the symbols of confidence and stability are blowing - and not the rags and terrorists,"" he said. But his Rhe Torik can not hide the fact that his government has no plan for a post-war order. It is easier to invade a country than to come out again. Erdogan calls the city of Jabulusul, the place that the Turkish soldiers co-operated with FSA a year and a half ago, as a blueprint for Afrin Fighters from the ""Islamic State"" and has been administered by Turkey ever since. But both cities can hardly be compared. Most of the Arabs live in Jabulus, who welcomed the Turkish soldiers and the FSA as a protective power. The Kurds in Afrin, on the other hand, regard Turkey as an intruder. Although not all residents of the city support the YPG yet, they are unlikely to accept a Turkish occupation without resistance.Othman Sheikh Issa, the deputy head of the Kurdish administration in Afrin, is threatening a guerrilla war: ""Our troops are in the entire vicinity of Afrin These troops will fight the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries wherever possible. ""Video: Tanks Roll into the Center of AfrinErdogan now has two options in Afrin: he can forcibly consolidate his rule over the city. He would have to permanently station a large number of Turkish soldiers and police in Afrin, who would be exposed to the constant danger of attacks and uprisings. Or Turkey leaves the city to the regime of Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad. For Erdogan, that would be a blah mage. He condemned Assad as a terrorist and perpetrated his fall. Citizens in Turkey would hardly understand why Turkish soldiers had to die for Assad. The Turkish president could soon have a similar experience in Syria as his former American counterpart George W. Bush did in Iraq: it is easier to invade a country than come out again.",Yazidis Sheikh Issa Tayyip Erdogan RUSSIA Citizens Arabs YPG Kandil Afrin Turkmens SYRIA Jabulusul Fighters Assad Recep Tayyip Manbij Othman Sheikh Der Spiegel Kawa Aleppo TURKEY Piece Bush Kemal Kilicdaroglu FSA AfrinErdogan IRAQ PKK Bashar Islamic State George Kurdish Army Kurds UNITED STATES Observers People,"https://sputniknews.com/russia/201803191062685853-putin-elections-congratulations-world-leaders/:  Special Message From ChinaChinese leader Xi Jinping, who has been recently re-elected himself, was among the first to congratulate the president on his re-election.

Those involved in the feud, which centres around the Velt server operators, reportedly claimed their opponents engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. An unverified image on social media claims to show the email sent to schools saying: “The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time if you do not send $5,000.""It adds: “If you do not sent the money we will blow up the device.“If you try to call the cops we WILL blow up the device on the SPOT. ANY attempt at defusing it your self will cause it to explode.”Cardinal Road School in Feltham, Hounslow, is one of the schools evacuated in London.Schools in Stevenage, Watford, St Albans, Hemel Hempstead and Hertford have also received bomb threats.The Valley School in Stevenage decided to evacuate the pupils after receiving a bomb threat this morning.Hertfordshire police said: “We did not advise any schools ourselves to evacuate but The Valley School in Stevenage made the decision to evacuate and we sent officers to as sist them.”Carson Kallen, chief executive of VELT, the Michigan-based company that runs VeltPvP, told The Telegraph that they believe the email was set from ""a group of hackers”.""Please collect your child as soon as possible.""Schools in Chiswick, Ilford and Lambeth in the capital have also been evacuated.A Hounslow Council spokesman said: “Several schools are affected in Hounslow.""Initially we thought it was isolated to one school.

It told children to contact them if they wanted to “get out of school”.In Yorkshire, police said it had sent its Cybercrime Unit Detectives to look at the emails, and said “it is not believed there is any genuine threat”.The Met Police said eight schools were emailed in Hounslow, but it was up to the schools, not police, whether to evacuate.In Humberside, 12 schools have told police they have received the email, and have been told not to evacuate.Dowdales Secondary School in Dalton, Cumbria evacuated pupils as a precaution.Lakes College in Workington and North Lakes Primary School in Penrith also received the bomb threat in Cumbria.At least 35 schools have been affected in Northumbria, while nine were sent the threats in Lincolnshire.A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ""We have received reports from a large number of schools in our region they they have received threatening emails.""The emails inform the school that a bomb has been placed on the grounds and will be detonated if they don't hand over cash.""Detectives have looked into the emails, which appear to originate from the US, and can confirm there is no viable threat.""Schools have been visited by police to reassure them that the incident is being treated as a hoax and address any concerns.""We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and an investigation into the emails in question is underway.""A stateme nt from the Met Police said: “Police are investigating reports of communications made to a number of schools across London today, Monday, 19 March.“There have been no arrests.

Washington RUSSIA,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html:  MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",MANCHESTER RUSSIA Make Bush Justice Department Republican Flood Robert Sam Clovis John Dowd Emmet Jr Trump Donald Ms Erik Prince Mark Corallo diGenova Ethics Columbia Joe District Columbia Washington Mueller George Joseph Toensing Clinton SEYCHELLES UNITED STATES Fox News,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html:  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Leon RUSSIA Republican White House Bob Capitol Hill GERMANY Center Vicki Divoll Freeh Fake Memos Mike Zero Republicans Louis Michael Gary Washington Mueller Obama Andy Usually Twitter Fox News Enterprise Institute Andrew Panetta McCabe Robert WASHINGTON Bromwich Senate Intelligence Trump Lewinsky Ronald Reagan Dem Dowd James Comey Richard Nixon Clinton Schmitt Jeremy Bash Brennan UNITED STATES John Intelligence Committee,"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/19/where-is-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-cambridge-analytica-scandal:  The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices, and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unl ikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.Referencing the government’s request for Facebook’s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica’s offices, Collins tweeted: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.”The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing.",Twitter UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Cambridge Analytica Alex Stamos Stroz Friedberg UK CEOs Senate Sheryl Sandberg WheresZuck Damian Collins DeleteFacebook Ron Wyden Washington CSO Global Science Mark Zuckerberg Google Information Commissioner John Kennedy Science Research

The CEC said that this year the current head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin won with a significant advantage. Vladimir Putin's re-election was already greeted by a number of foreign leaders. However, there were those who questioned the honesty of the process. Among those who congratulated the current head of Russia on the victory in the election - Chairman of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In his telegram, it is noted that ""at present, China-Russia relations of all-round strategic cooperation and partnership have reached an unprecedented high level."" In addition, the Foreign Ministry of China noted that they are preparing for the future visit of the Russian president. Presumably, it may take place in June as part of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Qingdao. Putin's dinner talks about the level of people's high trust, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko believes. ""This result demonstrates the high confidence and support of the citizens of Russia for the sustainable social and economic development of the country, strengthening its authority on the international arena,"" the congratulatory message says.

Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum. On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair. And we drew attention to the Western media, which, under the influence of any lobby, make comments about the dishonesty of the elections.

I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

(Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Leon RUSSIA Republican White House Bob Capitol Hill GERMANY Center Vicki Divoll Freeh Fake Memos Mike Zero Republicans Louis Michael Gary Washington Mueller Obama Andy Usually Twitter Fox News Enterprise Institute Andrew Panetta McCabe Robert WASHINGTON Bromwich Senate Intelligence Trump Lewinsky Ronald Reagan Dem Dowd James Comey Richard Nixon Clinton Schmitt Jeremy Bash Brennan UNITED STATES John Intelligence Committee,"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fans-notice-what-arsenal-youngster-12216439:  Eddie Nketiah's talent earned him a place on Arsenal's bench for their Europa League last-16 second leg against AC Milan on Thursday night - and fans all spotted the same thing.The 18-year-old, who has scored 10 goals in 12 Premier League 2 appearances this season, made headlines back in October after coming on as a substitute to score a winning brace against Norwich in the EFL Cup.But despite the Gunners starlet having also come off the bench five times for Arsenal in the Europa League, it appears he still gets a little starstruck around the big names.After Mesut Ozil was substituted in the 79th minute, the German took a seat on the bench next to Nketiah.BT Sport cameras focused on the pair only for fans to spot the forward simply staring at his team-mate.One fan tweeted: ""Nketiah spent a solid 5-10 seconds looking at Ozil here, living the dream.""Another supported added: ""Marry the person who looks at you the way Nketiah looks at Mesut Ozil.""Ozil proved to be Wenger's third substitution against AC Milan which meant Nketiah had to settle with just watching his side beat the Serie A giants from sides.Goals from Danny Welbeck and Granit Xhaka put the Gunners through to the quarter-finals where they will now face CSKA Moscow.",Arsenal RUSSIA Marry Goals Granit Xhaka Norwich Serie CSKA Mesut Ozil Danny Welbeck Gunners Wenger GERMANY BHUTAN Eddie Nketiah Sport Europa League

Vladimir Putin's re-election was already greeted by a number of foreign leaders. However, there were those who questioned the honesty of the process. Among those who congratulated the current head of Russia on the victory in the election - Chairman of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In his telegram, it is noted that ""at present, China-Russia relations of all-round strategic cooperation and partnership have reached an unprecedented high level."" In addition, the Foreign Ministry of China noted that they are preparing for the future visit of the Russian president. Presumably, it may take place in June as part of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Qingdao. Putin's dinner talks about the level of people's high trust, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko believes. ""This result demonstrates the high confidence and support of the citizens of Russia for the sustainable social and economic development of the country, strengthening its authority on the international arena,"" the congratulatory message says. Venezuelan and Nicolas Maduro and Raul Castro expressed condolences. The leader of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said that the result of voting in Russia was convincing: ""This victory testifies to your high political authority and active support of your course directed to ensure stability, law and order in the country, implementation of large-scale reforms, implementation of long-term social programs that contribute to the welfare of the people, ""it follows from Aliyev's message.

Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum.

Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair.

Hello! This is Sergey, the editor. For a long time I watched Varlamov postulate his theses about the benefits of elections in Russia, but even my patience comes to an end.

No more strength to listen to this nonsense ... Maybe we will discuss?



1. You can not go to elections

Here everything is simple. If you are against the regime, but go to the polls, then you automatically contribute to its legitimization. If you are against Putin, but go to the polls, then you are for Putin. In today's Russia, the only adequate and only visible way to state your protest is to completely ignore the electoral system.

You are aware that without throwing in will not do. You know that, perhaps, the main opposition politician in the country is not allowed before the elections on artificial grounds. On your eyes, the regime in the most fantastic ways tries to increase the turnout, so that more sheep come to the slaughterhouse from the free pastures. But you still drag yourself to the site to pay your respects to Mr. Putin.

Remember: if you urge to go to the polls without fail to ""express your opinion"", then you are a man harmful to Russia. As harmful as any system manager from EdRa.

""Go on dick, beaver collar, I'm not going to play by your rules!"" - that's what you have to say.

Here an impatient reader, a dashing quilted jacket or a ""permitted"" apple-type liberal already wants to accuse me of sympathy for Navalny, but he is disappointed. I have no sympathy for Navalny. It was once, in 2009-2010, but it all came out.

The fact is that in the talent those instantly change their shoes Navalny is like a 9th grade student, at a rush to a kiosk for beer and cigarettes, but still unable to overcome the checkpoint on duty without a change.

In December 2011, Navalny shouted into the microphone that the Kremlin can be taken even now. In August 2013, he willingly used the signatures of ""EdRa"" to run for the post of the mayor of Moscow. Now that he was not allowed to vote before the elections, Navalny immediately made a poker deal and said that the election is, it turns out, full of bullshit, and all of us were dragged bad cats by the nose!

In short, this way: I am very grateful to the UVP of the Administration of the President of Russia for instructing Mr. Navalny and his supporters on the true path. So we will win!



Those who constantly go to the polls and then beleaguered polls from polling stations should ask themselves one simple question: what good happened in the political life of Russia in the past 6 and a half years?

Well, at first, the Moscow opposition tusovka moved from ""Jean-Jacques"" to Telegram (and some also abroad). This is the main achievement, I believe. Prisoners of Marsh went out of prison. Someone received fresh grants. The site ""Mediason"" (I'm serious this time: this is really very important and very useful). Katz and Gudkov conducted a municipal campaign, and then - you will not believe it! - razosralis ... And that defended the independent mundepy Moscow trolleybus or green blocks of Khrushchev? Ah ha ha ha ha!

A significant victory, in fact, was only one - the advent of Roizma on to Ekaterinburg. But it, as I understand it, some kind of concession to the authorities personally Prokhorov, and not you. In addition, Roizman was a political freak even by the standards of the opposition.

Nemtsov was killed. The system makers of Ulyukaev and Belykh are sitting. Semisystemist Urlashov is sitting. If even one more independent mayor or governor is elected, he will be imprisoned too. How do you like this situation, dear fans of campaigns for elections? Is this an honest game, or was the bottle neck just anatomical enough?


2. Putin's interest is not an invention of the Kremlin

Yes, here I agree with Varlamov. The blatant screams of demshiz that Putin does not enjoy popular support is some kind of enchanting delirium.

When the leader, pumped up with propaganda, gives the illusion of power and greatness to a humiliated (even if supposedly humiliated) country, this always brings fruit. This was the case when Hitler was building the ideology of his state on the basis of hatred of internal and external enemies. The masses applauded him when he seized Austria and tore Czechoslovakia apart. Europe was shaking and was unable to intervene ...

Does not it look like anything?


3. Russia is ruled by grandmothers

The core of Putin's electorate is women over 45 years old. The most fat layer of those who vote for Putin is a grandmother from the age of 60. Who sit at home, do nothing, watch television, enjoy the success of the country listed in the program ""Time"", and they want you all to live in shit.

Is it possible to change this statistics or somehow draw it to your advantage? Not sure. And in general, how much Putin can a country still swallow?

Kaza The dependence should be very simple: the worse the people live, the weaker the position of the government. But this is all nonsense. The historical experience of Russia (Ivan IV, Stalin - yes anyone) and the life of some modern states (DPRK, Venezuela, African dictatorships) clearly demonstrates that peoples are subject to the Stockholm syndrome no worse than individuals. This means that Russia will accept Putin until one of the two elements disappears: either Putin or Russia. Or maybe both.

And then I turn to the last point.


4. Salvation of drowning people - not business

So, the Russians have made their choice. For the next 20 years, a noble cross between the Politburo and the State Emergency Committee will rule the country. The other day you will for sure reveal the secret of stability and continuity of the process of getting up from your knees.

But since Russia is a country of forestry, when you cut a forest, you will surely fly to a well-groomed person. And there are some points to which you will have to take your understanding:

If suddenly it turns out that the cops shoved your child into a ""bobik"", taken to the police station and tortured all night with an electric shock, do not be too surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your mother has cancer, but you can not get painkillers for her, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your uncle was summoned from the reserve and sent off to fight somewhere, and there he was cut off his head, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your sister was carried away by feminism, and her brave Cossacks whipped her for this, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly ok It seems that your dog was knocked down by a buoyant judge on his BMW, and then you had to pay for the repair of his car, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that your business was squeezed out by an ethnic organized crime group, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the Kremlin was demolished, in order to build a shopping mall and an elite 40-story LCD, instead of it, do not be surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that a park was cut down next to your house and a temple and a junction built in its place, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that there is no longer a trolley and a tram in your city, although it has always been (even in the ""dashing 90s""), do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the road surface in your city has eroded to the mantle of the Earth, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your street was flooded with the blood of sacrificial rams, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 5,000 people were killed at the plant of your monotown, and then they closed the enterprise altogether, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that you can not go to Turkey or Egypt, because it requires an exit visa, which is given only to spies and artists of the Bolshoi Theater, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that all the decent products from the stores have disappeared, and instead of them there is a ""plastic porridge"" on the shelves, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that you were given a hectare of land in the Far East, and then the Ministry of Defense, FSO or the FSB seized it for their own needs, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your cottage has collapsed full th Heptyla Proton-M rocket with another satellite, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 30 years have passed, and no Russia is already there, do not be very surprised.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.",UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Parliament Cambridge Analytica Republican News Bannon Caribbean House Commons Mark Turnbull Zuckerberg WASHINGTON Stroz Friedberg Trump York Times Robert Mercer Stephen IDs Observer New York EU SCL Group Damian Collins Elizabeth Denham Channel Berkeley Africa UNITED STATES Elections Alexander Nix,"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-russia-spy-poisoning-latest-novichok-nerve-agent-programme-handover-putin-uk-a8262966.html:  The European Union has demanded that the Russian government hand over for scrutiny all information about the nerve agent that allegedly poisoned a former spy on British soil.At a meeting in Brussels on Monday the EU’s 28 foreign ministers condemned the “reckless and illegal” poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and said information about the Novichok nerve agent should be handed over to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigation.  The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect.

UNITED STATES RUSSIA,"http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/tuerkei-fuer-recep-tayyip-erdogan-fangen-die-probleme-in-afrin-erst-an-a-1198817.html:  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claims his military liberate the Turkish-Syrian border area from terrorists. But on the people of the city of Afrin, in north-western Syria, Turkey's invasion on Sunday must have been like the appearance of an occupying power. Turkish soldiers hoisted the flag of their country over buildings of the administration. Their allies from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) plundered food, electrical appliances, motorcycles, goats, set fire to shops selling alcohol. Fighters drove forward with bulldozers and tore the statue of blacksmith Kawa, a Kurdish legend figure, from the pedestal. For Erdogan the conquest of Afrin means a military success. His army marched into the province of Afrin on January 20 to fight the Kurdish militia YPG. Piece by piece, the soldiers had moved from the border to the center of the province. Since the beginning of last week, they besieged the city of Afrin. Observers had forecast weeks, possibly months, of battles. Ultimately, however, the YPG retreated, with almost no resistance. ""The terrorists ran away with their tails tucked in,"" Erdogan mocked. Turkey has also defeated the world powers USA and Russia in Afrin, added one of its advisors. Government-run Turkish newspapers wrote on Monday about a ""Victory Day"" and a ""Day of Pride."" ""We wrote history in Afrin."" And even opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu spoke of a ""heroic battle"". ""Human lives count nothing"" For the majority of people in Afrin, however, the fall of their hometown is a disaster. Afrin was one of the few regions in Syria that had been largely spared the horror of the civil war so far. Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens, Yazidis found refuge here and lived side by side in a largely peaceful way. Tens of thousands are now on the run. People have to watch their homes being looted and do not know when and under what circumstances they can return. ""Here in Syria everyone has their own war,"" said a resident of Afrin Der Spiegel. ""Human lives count for nothing."" Erdogan is likely to feel affirmed in his war policy by defeating the YPG in Afrin. He sees the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdish terrorist organization PKK and has already announced that they want to pursue the militia to the border with Iraq. His government is currently negotiating with the US for a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from Manbij, a city east of Afrin. Turkish soldiers in Afrin respond to a journalist's question about their goals: ""Manbij, Aleppo, Kandil"" (PKK Headquarters). In the medium term, however, the military could take revenge on Turkey. Although Erdogan is self-confident: ""In the center of Afrin now the symbols of confidence and stability are blowing - and not the rags and terrorists,"" he said. But his Rhe Torik can not hide the fact that his government has no plan for a post-war order. It is easier to invade a country than to come out again. Erdogan calls the city of Jabulusul, the place that the Turkish soldiers co-operated with FSA a year and a half ago, as a blueprint for Afrin Fighters from the ""Islamic State"" and has been administered by Turkey ever since. But both cities can hardly be compared. Most of the Arabs live in Jabulus, who welcomed the Turkish soldiers and the FSA as a protective power. The Kurds in Afrin, on the other hand, regard Turkey as an intruder. Although not all residents of the city support the YPG yet, they are unlikely to accept a Turkish occupation without resistance.Othman Sheikh Issa, the deputy head of the Kurdish administration in Afrin, is threatening a guerrilla war: ""Our troops are in the entire vicinity of Afrin These troops will fight the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries wherever possible. ""Video: Tanks Roll into the Center of AfrinErdogan now has two options in Afrin: he can forcibly consolidate his rule over the city. He would have to permanently station a large number of Turkish soldiers and police in Afrin, who would be exposed to the constant danger of attacks and uprisings. Or Turkey leaves the city to the regime of Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad. For Erdogan, that would be a blah mage. He condemned Assad as a terrorist and perpetrated his fall. Citizens in Turkey would hardly understand why Turkish soldiers had to die for Assad. The Turkish president could soon have a similar experience in Syria as his former American counterpart George W. Bush did in Iraq: it is easier to invade a country than come out again.",Yazidis Sheikh Issa Tayyip Erdogan RUSSIA Citizens Arabs YPG Kandil Afrin Turkmens SYRIA Jabulusul Fighters Assad Recep Tayyip Manbij Othman Sheikh Der Spiegel Kawa Aleppo TURKEY Piece Bush Kemal Kilicdaroglu FSA AfrinErdogan IRAQ PKK Bashar Islamic State George Kurdish Army Kurds UNITED STATES Observers People,"https://ruposters.ru/news/19-03-2018/makarevich-nazval-rossiyan:  Musician Andrey Makarevich in Facebook compared the ""quiet, kind and funny"" Americans with Russians, whom he called ""spiteful morons.""

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia.

""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",MANCHESTER RUSSIA Make Bush Justice Department Republican Flood Robert Sam Clovis John Dowd Emmet Jr Trump Donald Ms Erik Prince Mark Corallo diGenova Ethics Columbia Joe District Columbia Washington Mueller George Joseph Toensing Clinton SEYCHELLES UNITED STATES Fox News,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html:  As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.The impending exit of that executive — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer — reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controv ersy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, accord ing to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook i nitially denied.By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust, ’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”",Tavis McGinn RUSSIA Democratic National Munich Alex Stamos Capitol Hill National Committee Center Yahoo Pedro Canahuati Honest Data Sheryl Sandberg DNC Sandy Parakilas Senator Elliot Schrage Clinton Warner Virginia Mark Zuckerberg UNITED STATES San Francisco Democrat Humane Technology,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html:  WASHINGTON — Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.",UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Parliament Cambridge Analytica Republican News Bannon Caribbean House Commons Mark Turnbull Zuckerberg WASHINGTON Stroz Friedberg Trump York Times Robert Mercer Stephen IDs Observer New York EU SCL Group Damian Collins Elizabeth Denham Channel Berkeley Africa UNITED STATES Elections Alexander Nix,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html:  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Leon RUSSIA Republican White House Bob Capitol Hill GERMANY Center Vicki Divoll Freeh Fake Memos Mike Zero Republicans Louis Michael Gary Washington Mueller Obama Andy Usually Twitter Fox News Enterprise Institute Andrew Panetta McCabe Robert WASHINGTON Bromwich Senate Intelligence Trump Lewinsky Ronald Reagan Dem Dowd James Comey Richard Nixon Clinton Schmitt Jeremy Bash Brennan UNITED STATES John Intelligence Committee,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/hidden-camera-shows-cambridge-analytica-pitching-tricky-tactics-n857936:  In a meeting with the head of Cambridge Analytica — the political data firm used by the Trump campaign in 2016 — reporters from NBC News’ U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 News posed as potential clients interested in changing the outcome of the Sri Lankan elections.The reporters, who were trying to find out how the company operated, quickly learned about the novel and deceptive methods employed by the company, including bribes, blackmail, and misinformation campaigns. The findings were broadcast by the network on Monday.On hidden camera, the reporters recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, ""an offer he can't refuse"" or ""send some girls around to the candidate’s house.""Nix also floated the idea of spreading misinformation about politicians.""It doesn't have to be true,"" Nix said. ""It just has to be believed.""He later discussed creating fake IDs and having people pose as students or tourists as a way to further the political efforts without having its work traced back to clients.Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was also recorded by the ITN Channel 4 News reporters discussing his relationships with former British spies now working at private companies who can be contracted to gather intelligence, along with private Israeli intelligence companies.Long a company of interest in the Tru mp-Russia investigation, Cambridge Analytica came under fresh scrutiny this past weekend after the company's former director of data research, Christopher Wylie, revealed how the company had mined data from at least 50 million Facebook users.Publicly, the company advertises its ability to build ""psychographic"" profiles that can microtarget social media political advertising to people based on traits like ""extroversion"" or ""neuroticism.""The company received a $15 million investment from wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, who also funded the conservative website Breitbart while Steve Bannon — who later became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign — was at the helm.A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied to ITN Channel 4 News that it used any of the tactics discussed in the videos.“We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,"" the spokesperson sent in a statement.“Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose,” the spokesperson added.Bannon met with Nix and was interested in how the profiles could be used to change American politics, Wylie said.""Steve wanted weapons for a culture war. We offered him a way to change the culture of America,"" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. Sources familiar with Cambridge Analytica’s work on the Trump campaign say “psychographics” were not used.A source familiar with the hiring of Cambridge An alytica told NBC News that the primary figures involved in the hiring were Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, who was digital director of the Trump campaign. Parscale has denied that the firm was useful to the campaign and said the Trump campaign instead used data from the Republican National Committee.On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from buying ads or administering pages on its platform on behalf of clients, saying its data policies had been violated.""We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the claims.The developments drew rebuke from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic over the weekend.“Revelations that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired the personal, private information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission or that of Facebook, must be thoroughly investigated,"" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should appear before the panel to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its customers' data.Those calls were echoed by Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling during Brexit. In previous hearings on the topic, the social media platforms sent their general counsel or policy directors.Facebook shares slumped 8 percent Monday.",ISRAEL NBC News UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Cambridge Analytica Republican ITN Channel Mark Turnbull National Committee Brexit Long Trump Robert Mercer Senate Jared Kushner Damian Collins Steve Bannon Atlantic Political Global Wylie UNITED STATES Brad Parscale Alexander Nix,"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-russia-spy-poisoning-latest-novichok-nerve-agent-programme-handover-putin-uk-a8262966.html:  The European Union has demanded that the Russian government hand over for scrutiny all information about the nerve agent that allegedly poisoned a former spy on British soil.At a meeting in Brussels on Monday the EU’s 28 foreign ministers condemned the “reckless and illegal” poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and said information about the Novichok nerve agent should be handed over to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigation.  The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",Commission UNITED KINGDOM Republic Alexander Litvinenko OPCW RUSSIA Novichok SPAIN Yulia Skripal March SWEDEN Kingdom Salisbury CZECH REPUBLIC Alfonso Dastis BELGIUM EU Convention Russ Boris Johnson Vladimir Putin SLOVAKIA Federica Mogherini Sergei UNITED STATES Chemical Weapons

The plaintiffs about Nixon's possible participation in the elections went in 2017. She repeatedly criticized the incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is going to be re-elected in 2018. And Cuomo, and Nixon are claiming nominations from the Democratic Party. According to recent polls, Cuomo is supported by 66 percent of Democrats, Nixon - 19 percent. The primaries, on which the candidate will be determined, will be held in September.",Actress Cynthia Miranda Democratic Party City New York Cynthia Nixon Sex,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/nyregion/cynthia-nixon-new-york-governor-cuomo.html:  The actress Cynthia Nixon officially jumped into the race for governor of New York on Monday, setting off what promises to be a tumultuous six months as she challenges Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in this year’s Democratic primary.Ms. Nixon, 51, has never before run for elected office and has chosen a huge undertaking for her first bid: seeking to unseat a two-term incumbent (and son of a three-term governor) who is sitting atop more than $30 million in campaign cash.The contest will likely become one of the marquee Democratic primaries in the nation, as Ms. Nixon is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the political left. Her campaign immediately cast Mr. Cuomo as a “centrist and Albany insider,” and some of her initial rhetoric on inequality echoed Senator Bernie Sanders.“We are now the most unequal state in the entire country, with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty,” she said in a video posted on Twitter announcing her candidacy.Splashed across the top of her website are more hints of her campaign’s coming focus. One of the five categories — along with “Meet Cynthia” and “Donate” — is a hashtag: #CuomosMTA, a term used often by critics of the governor for New York’s faltering subway system run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Scenes of her riding the subways are also spliced in her opening ad.Ms. Nixon, best known for her work in the “Sex and the City” franchise, is expected to lean heavily on her star power and ability to draw media attention in ways that most traditional challengers could not.Within 18 minutes of posting her announcement video on Monday, she was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter in New York, and then nationwide 20 minutes after that. Her video topped 1 million views on Twitter alone by the evening.But her campaign may test the appetite of New Yorkers for a celebrity leader in the age of President Trump, a deeply unpopular figure here among Democrats. While Ms. Nixon has been an education activist for many years her fame could cut both ways in the coming months.Mr. Cuomo has downplayed the challenge in recent days, even as his political operation has busily sought to burnish his progressive credentials.“I’m not nervous about whoever runs,” Mr. Cuomo said last week. “There’ll be people who run. That’s called elections, and that’s fine.”If elected, Ms. Nixon would become the first female governor, and the first openly gay governor, in New York history.“Our leaders are letting us down,” she said in the announcement video.“Something has to change,” she said in the ad. “We want our government to work again, on health care, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway. We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us. It can’t just be business as usual anymore.”The language on her website was more aggressive. There, she accused Mr. Cuomo of “inhumane budgets” and of “selling New York off to the highest bidder.”Mr. Cuomo begins the race as a heavy front-runner. A Siena College poll on Monday had him leading Ms. Nixon among registered Democrats 66 percent to 19 percent. But an ugly primary could affect the governor beyond 2018, should he run for president in 2020.Jefrey Pollock, a longtime pollster for Mr. Cuomo, was dismissive of Ms. Nixon, saying that Democratic voters are especially uninterested in celebrity leaders in the current political climate, and prefer candidates who can “counter what they see as the chaos of the inexperienced.”“They are looking for proven experience to take the fight to Donald Trump and to Republicans across the state,” he said.Four years ago, Zephyr Teachout, a virtually unknown law professor, jolted the New York political scene when she scored more than 34 percent of the vote in her run against Mr. Cuomo, who largely ignored her. Ms. Teachout has signed on as Ms. Nixon’s campaign treasurer.Mr. Cuomo has remained a polarizing figure, particularly among Democratic activists, even as he has increasingly shifted leftward in recent years, enacting a minimum-wage increase, paid family leave and free college tuition scholarships for middle-class families.A powerful figure known for his long memory, Mr. Cuomo is expected to consolidate much of the institutional support across the state, from labor unions to business leaders to major donors. (Last week, before Ms. Nixon officially entered the contest, the New York arm of the National Organization for Women endorsed the governor.)For Ms. Nixon, that likely means sh e must run an insurgent campaign, and early indications are she will focus on digital organizing. She has tapped as campaign manager Nicole Aro, a former digital strategist for the AFL-CIO.Tim Tagaris, who served as digital fund-raising director for Mr. Sanders’ presidential campaign, has also signed on to help Ms. Nixon, according to two people familiar with the situation.In addition, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, two former strategists for Mayor Bill de Blasio, have been advising Ms. Nixon’s campaign.Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have sparred for years, and the mayor is close to Ms. Nixon, who aggressively endorsed his initial candidacy in 2013. Ms. Nixon’s wife, Christine Marinoni, recently stepped down from a post in the de Blasio administration.Mr. Cuomo has yet to build out his campaign team, despite his sizable treasury. His campaign manager from his 2010 and 2014 races, Joseph Percoco, was convicted on bribery charges last week in a federal trial.Still, he has vast resources at his fingertips. Last week, the state Democratic Party bought $100,000 in television ads touting Mr. Cuomo’s efforts on gun control. The party later said Mr. Cuomo’s campaign covered the cost.Born and raised in New York, Ms. Nixon attended Hunter College High School and Barnard College while breaking into acting. She is best known for playing Miranda Hobbes on “Sex and the City,” a world-weary lawyer navigating life in late-1990s and early-2000s New York. In a plot twist that now seems quaint, Mira nda horrified her friends by moving from a Manhattan apartment to a brownstone in Brooklyn.Now she’ll be stumping for votes in both boroughs.Ms. Nixon mostly narrates her opening two-minute video, but as she rides a train in the final moments, the conductor can be heard overhead: “Next stop is Albany.”",Party Brooklyn Albany Nicole Aro CuomosMTA High School Siena College Joseph Percoco Zephyr Teachout Trump Miranda Hobbes Barnard Ms City New York Cynthia Nixon Transportation Authority Blasio Scenes AFL Democratic Manhattan Sex Hunter Metropolitan Transportation Splashed Christine Marinoni Jefrey Pollock Donald,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cynthia-nixon-runs-new-york-governor_us_5a9ef285e4b0d4f5b66b1987:  Tony-award winning actress Cynthia Nixon announced on Monday through an ad on her Twitter account that she is running for New York state governor.Nixon, known for her role on HBO’s “Sex and the City,” will be running as a Democrat against incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) in the state’s primary election, set for September. The actress is a newcomer to campaigning, but has been involved in politics, especially education policy, for years. “We want our government to work again, on healthcare, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway. We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us,” Nixon said in her announcement.The Wall Street Journal originally reported rumors in late 2017 that Nixon was planning a gubernatorial run, and NY1 followed up this month after Nixon reportedly met with two Democratic strategists. In her two-minute announcement, Nixon focused on her longtime advocacy for public education, reminding voters that she and her three children attended New York City public schools. She also touched on the city’s deteriorating subway system, a topic that has plagued Cuomo for years.  Nixon attacked the incumbent governor directly in her press release. “Cuomo’s time in office has been defined by a string of indictments for corruption, his failure to fix the New York City subway, and his support for a backroom deal which handed Republicans control of the state Senate, resulting in the failure of numerous pieces of progressive legislation,” the press release stated.Nixon has been involved in New York City politics since 2014, when Mayor Bill de Blasio placed her on the advisory board for the Mayor’s Fund To Advance New York City. Christine Marinoni, Nixon’s wife, became the special adviser for community partnerships with the city’s Department of Education that same year.In that time, Nixon has spoken critically about Cuomo’s work as governor in various forums. The actress told “The View” last year that even Cuomo’s most praised policies, such as free tuition at four-year state colleges, barely scratch the surface of the state’s needs. “Basically, it only affects families that earn between $75,000 and $125,000 a year,” Nixon said on “The View.” “And it doesn’t apply to people who go part-time, which means they might have to work while they’re there, or they don’t graduate in four years, or they’re Dreamers.”Nixon also wrote an op-ed for LoHud.com about public school funding that compared Cuomo, a Democrat, to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a Donald Trump nominee.“[Cuomo] also wants to increase the number of privately-run charter schools in New York City by more than 50 percent,” Nixon wrote. “And he has been a loud proponent of private school tax credits, essentially a backdoor voucher system. These are policies we expect from Betsy DeVos, but from Andrew Cuomo?”The award-winning actress is looking to dethrone the two-term governor, who has been battling public transit issues and a federal investigation into his administration’s payroll. Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Cuomo, was found guilty in a corruption scandal after allegedly taking $300,000 in bribes from executives with state business.A Siena College poll released Monday showed that despite the scandal, Cuomo leads Nixon with 66 percent of Democratic voters.Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated Nixon “poses a credible threat” to Cuomo. This story has been updated to include details about a Monday poll that shows Cuomo significantly ahead of Nixon, as well as information about Percoco’s guilty verdict.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Cuomo in September’s Democratic primary.The lefty actress, who had been flirting with a bid for months, released a slick online video that announced her candidacy — and took plenty of digs at Cuomo.“New York is my home. I’ve never lived anywhere else,’’ Nixon says in the video, which included her and her wife, education activist Christine Marinoni, and the actress’s three children.“But something has to change,’’ Nixon, 51, says against a backdrop of gray, blighted streets.“Our leaders are letting us down,” she says. “We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us. It can’t just be business as usual anymore.”Describing the governor as a “centrist and insider,’’ Nixon added that Cuomo has “been defined by a string of indictments for corruption,” failed to fix the subways and is in cahoots with the GOP through a “backroom deal” that allows them to control the state Senate.Her celebrity status — Nixon played the sensible Miranda on the hit HBO series — immediately paid off in terms of publicity for her campaign.News of the actress’s first bid for political office dominated the Internet and was trending on Facebook and Twitter.Former “SATC” co-star Kristin Davis, who portrayed conservative Charlotte, added to the star power, tweeting, “I am so proud of @cynthiaNixon . . .

Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum. On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed.

And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said.

In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel.

GERMANY Angela Merkel,"https://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/die-vermiedene-debatte-merkels-geistlose-antwort-auf-die-islam-frage-a2378410.html:  It came as a side note therefore, without much media attention. The representative survey conducted by the pollster Civey deserves much more attention. But it just did not fit into the happy transported world view of the journalists. And she certainly did not fit the Chancellor's agenda. Quite the contrary. The clear answer of the citizens to the question of whether Islam belongs to Germany was a resounding slap in the face for Angela Merkel. She had just recently blabbed out her new interior minister Horst Seehofer publicly that he had dared to pronounce the day before, in which three quarters of the Germans confirm that Islam does not belong to Germany. Only just over 20 percent of the representative respondents think it is Merkel's opinion. where a small group absolutely approves of the question. The number of those who believe that Islam does not belong to Germany is steadily increasing. Last summer, this view represented ""only"" two-thirds of the Germans. The Chancellor is still stuck to her narrative. Bending and breaking should be hammered into the people that they would have to accept as part of their everyday life more and more influential in the wake of immigration religion, as incompatible with the decades-long understanding of democracy and the rule of law may be. The contradiction Merkel's Politburo to the ö Public opinion is so blatant that one has to ask oneself what drives the Chancellor. Nobody can be so ignorant as to be so stubborn against the people. Who writes Merkel's agenda, which seems to focus not least on serving Islam? A huge industry has long since emerged, which ensures across company, association and party boundaries that six million members of a particular religion make public life easier the remaining 77 million citizens. Most Muslims must be held accountable for being abused by politics and the media. But there are a large number of them, who see their religion not only as part of Germany, but work towards the fact that Germany as soon as possible belongs to Islam.Insofern the initial question is wrong, because it does not investigate the widespread rejection, the Hence, the intrusive behavior of the religious associations and the overblown political-media dininess fuel fears of losing public life to Islam. It can not surprise anyone if three-quarters of Germans oppose the idea of ​​eventually having to submit to Islam. And the concern is by no means as unfounded as politics and the media like to claim. Because the concessions to the Muslim religious community already intervene deeply in the social life. Separate swimming pool times for women at the expense of time For sport clubs, the renaming of Christ markets as a contribution to interfaith dialogue, and the banishment of pork from daycare cafeterias are far more than consideration - they are anticipatory obedience. Not to mention truck barriers to secure entire pedestrian areas and police escorts for the protection of paramedics , The enumeration can be continued to the point of self-flagellation of repentant companies for alleged anti-Muslim advertising. For this purpose, questionable associations get a say in government-related bodies, are installed at all political levels integration commissioners and subordinate to public bodies as well as private institutions as expensive as bizarre tolerance competition. Right of way for Islam, wherever one looks. Angela Merkel once again missed a chance: Instead of using the debate to confidently insist that religions have to submit to a free society, she has with her confession, the Islam belongs to Germany, to those who give absolution, who have no interest in assimilating. A responsible policy must not only protect religion from the state, but vice versa. Angela Merkel probably did not understand this aspect of her oath of office.

This is a motto that has so far not been associated with Angela Merkel's style of politics. Nevertheless, the fourth cabinet of the Chancellor takes up his work with unfamiliar roughness. Islam, poverty, abortion - the new government was barely in office and immediately ignited a firework of right-wing blast. Or is this a sign of Merkel's loss of control? Or the expression of a general mood, which - in a modification of a famous presidential statement - has the one demand: through Germany, a shift to the right! Horst Seehofer and Jens Spahn have in the Cabinet Merkel IV the role of conservative bang batches. Within a few days, one has expatriated Islam from Germany and the other only insulted Hartz IV recipients as crybabies and then compensated for abortions against animal welfare. Politics of the center is different. But who says that this government will make a policy of the middle? It is part of the essence of the Union to represent mostly the so-called healthy sense of the people. And right now, that's right. On the internet, you can read a ""2018 statement,"" which reads: ""We are watching with increasing consternation how Germany is damaged by illegal mass immigration, and we are solidarizing ourselves with those who peacefully demonstrate for it that the rule of law is restored at the borders of our country. "" These people talk about the law aat - in truth, they want the Rechtsruck.Vornweg run the usual suspects - Sarrazin, Broder, Lengsfeld -, followed by a lot of AfD sympathizers and other brown socks. And then there are all the angry professors and doctorses, the sour creme de la creme of the worried German bourgeoisie. They can not assert any extenuating circumstances for themselves - heavy Eastern childhood, fear of globalization or something - they know exactly what they are doing: they want pure Germany. And Horst Seehofer also knows what he does when he gives sugar to such people. ""Islam does not belong to Germany"" - the sentence was deliberately unclear because its meaning is completely different, depending on whether one understands it normatively or descriptively. Seehofer knows that, of course. But he does not care. In Bavaria is campaigning, Markus Söder had his first day in the State Chancellery - two good reasons to let out the Horst. And when it comes to Muslims, applies not only in Munich, the old sentence of Monaco Franze: A little bit what is always. But not the Muslims are the problem, but the potato Germans. Unfortunately, quite a few are grumpy, anxious, spoiled and haughty - and the dull-cheeked populism comes along, the greater is his chance of success with these people. Horst Seehofer's zenith as a populist is already behind him - but Jens Spahn still has his own. His comments on Hartz IV - is not poverty, one comes super with clear - could perhaps still be recorded as a typical cold-blooded capitalist sinism with which the better-off people have always looked down on the poor. However, what he said in the debate on paragraph 219a went one step further: ""When it comes to the lives of animals, some who now want to promote abortions are uncompromising, but sometimes there is not much going on in this debate considers that it is about unborn human life. ""Who is campaigning for abortion? What is Spahn talking about? Advertising for abortion would be for example: ""Abortion: the best thing about the North."" Or: ""Abortion ... I like it!"" Maybe also: ""losing weight without sports."" Or just like in the L'Tur advertisement: ""Nix wie weg!"" But the new health minister should know that the discussion is not about advertising, but about information. Of course he knows that. Right-wing populists always sell their audiences more stupid than they are themselves. When rights talk: like bookseller Heinz Ostermann of Terror Hartz IV: Black-Red is supposed to be a coalition of small people. Ulrike Winkelmann has her doubts there

They want to pull the coat over her ears and distribute it among themselves, even before she can say ""Peter Altmaier"". We are to blame ourselves. We left power in the hands of a chancellor who is only on call. But with the power it is just the same: once its end is in sight, it is in fact already achieved.

Had with the immigration of Turks and other Orientals in Germany Muslims came here and these now belong to our country, is not a question, as far as they are not in quasi But does the existence of Muslims in this country mean that Islam belongs to Germany, as the first Federal President, Christian Wulff, asserted in 2010? That was already the view of the Union parties - and not only there - many different: people he Kauder, head of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group, as well as the former Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich, for example, claimed the opposite and justified this - in the same sense as Seehofer - with the fact that Islam did not have influenced the traditions and identity of this country.Angela Merkel, who as chancellor had made her a master in weighing up, was probably trying to balance positions when she ambiguously suggested that Islam belonged to Germany as well as Muslims living here, ""we"" ( !), however, are ""based on the Christian-Jewish traditions."" Who are ""we"" and who are the Muslims who belong to this country, but apparently not with ""us"" because they stand on a different foundation? Chancellor and CDU chairman met, of course, with their attempt to balance vivid contradiction, especially since it is not only about the question of whether Islam is associated, but also whether or to what extent he should belong. Which Islam would be meant, wanted about Merkel's party colleague Wolfgang Bosbach know and asked if Islamist or even Salafist currents and Sharia should also belong to Germany. Still in the same direction, the Egyptian-born political scientist and former Muslim Brother Hamed Abdel-Samad went in an open letter to the Chancellor and demanded explain them to the citizens what Islam is, instead of just stating its affiliation. An explanation is The Chancellor had been as guilty as before, as well as an answer to the question of what she wanted to do against Islamization. When asked about it, she could not think of much more than to fool that many people who were afraid of Koran disbelief from Muslims , would not be bible itself. And Margot Käßmann, a trained pastor, wanted to take even worried Christians into prayer: Those who were ""afraid of full mosques"" would have to ""provide for full churches."" But church attendance and prayer would not have the Christians in the Middle East Hamed Abdel-Samad sneered at the two ""undisguised women"" - Merkel and Käßman. With the destabilization of state order in Iraq and Syria, Christianity, which has been part of the country for 2000 years, was largely helpless at the mercy of Muslim extremist terror. Many Christians from there, who sought protection here, as well as Yazidi suffered violence in some refugee housing by Muslims who had also made their way to us. Refugees who wanted to carry out religious conflicts in their countries of origin did not belong to us Hereby, said Aiman ​​Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. He probably wanted to meet the widespread and legitimate concern that with the refugee masses from the Orient increasingly extremists could haunt our country. Extremism would have nothing to do with Islam, one hears mantra-like from the mouth of Muslim representatives and party representatives, when extremists, referring to Islamic laws scorching and murdering moved through the country. ""Islam means peace,"" it says softly from the mouth of nice as well as obscure headscarves who in some places on the day of the open mosque greet the guests with flowers, as observed in mosque visits on the day as well as the reaction of many guests who nod in such a well-intentioned peace agreement and smile as if they were alms refuses to learn this from a vocation and, to that extent, does not have to fear that opponents of Islam might be right in their warnings; for a fear of this kind is just as symptomatic of Islamophobia as the fear of those for whom peace in the name of Islam is nothing more than a synonym for submission and for whom an Islamization of Europe would be equivalent to the fall of the West. No matter what such fears must hold It may be absurd to assert on the one hand that Islam belongs to Germany, but on the other hand to denounce Islamization. How else could a membership of Islam have arisen if there had not been a development that led to it and the name Islamization quite true? For this does not mean just conversion or even submission, but also a territorial spread of Islam, which is logically followed with the mass immigration of Muslims, unless the immigrants have given up their religious customs.Perhaps, those who are open to this question publicly Report words, not be so obtuse, but first think about what can be understood by ""belonging"" everything.

I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

The incumbent president received 77% of the votes cast by the electors who took part in the elections, and more than 50% - from the total payroll structure, after processing 99.9% of the ballots. This happens in Russia for the first time. The population supports Putin's foreign and domestic policies, and there is no alternative candidate, analysts of Alfa Bank state. The powerful support of the population gives the president the mandate for economic reforms - but he is unlikely to use them, they believe. After the elections, the government will focus on budgetary policy, and structural reforms will push back into the background, the note by Alfa Bank notes. But the support of voters can strengthen Russia's attempts to challenge the dominant role of the United States in the world, analysts believe. Analysts believe that it is not possible to interpret the results of the election so unambiguously, says Kirill Tremasov, director of the analytical department of Loko-Investa: the main task for the next term is to revive the economy. Without solving this problem, Putin's nuclear electorate can significantly reduce, the expert continues. ""He was forgiven for the economic failure in these six years for the Crimea, which divided people with liberal views on the economy in two, no matter what they said, but this electorate in large cities is estimated at tens of percent,"" Tremasov argues. But another six years of stagnation would be a very difficult test for the population. Nevertheless, now the task of reviving the economy is most likely to be considered without serious structural reforms (courts, state regulation, privatization) and the main emphasis will be placed on credit stimulation of economic growth, Tremasov said. ""In the short term, this can give a positive result, and then interest in structural reforms will really disappear completely,"" he believes. As a rule, the ""window of opportunities"" for reforms opens immediately after the elections, noted the head of the Economic Expert Group Evsei Gurvich: the elected leader receives a mandate even for unpopular reforms. On the eve of the third term, Putin had already proposed a program of reforms, the main tasks of which included his May decrees. For example, he instructed by 2018 to increase investments to 27% of GDP, and labor productivity - by 1.5 times, to raise Russia in the World Bank rating on the conditions of doing business from 120th to 20th place, to increase real wages in 1 , 4-1.5 times, salaries of teachers, doctors and scientists - up to 100-200% of the average for the region. But after the elections, the incentives for reforms were weakened by high oil prices, and then the events in Ukraine and sanctions followed, priorities changed, Gurvich said: it was necessary to restore macroeconomic stability, and geopolitics came to the fore. These presidential elections were exceptional in that, that the winning candidate did not set out an economic program at all, Economist of the BCS Vladimir Tikhomirov: there were no program statements, and from the clarifications of the future agenda Putin did not dodge at all. But he links it to the fact that after the election, Putin will take unpopular measures - the president received a very strong mandate of trust. Now there are many fundamental problems that need to be addressed: to change the structure of the economy, reform the pension system, and improve the demographic situation, Tikhomirov lists: without reforms, the economy can not grow faster. Indicative will be the composition of the government - whether Putin will appoint reformers or leave the previous team, he concludes. Changes in the government will occur after the inauguration, Putin said on Sunday after the election. Last week Putin again instructed the government to ensure the growth rate of the Russian economy is higher than the world level. Russia's economy is returning to cyclical growth, but without structural reforms it will be low - about 1.5-2 % per year, was noted in the economic monitoring of the Russian Academy of Science and Technology. Three key reform strategies were discussed: the Ministry of Economic Development proposes to stake on the growth of investments, non-primary exports and labor productivity, the Center for Strategic Research (TsSR) Alexei Kudrin - on the growth of aggregate factor productivity and investments in the most productive sectors, the Stolypin Club of the business ombudsman Boris Titov - to support a moderately weak exchange rate and stimulate demand for import substitution. Kudrin proposed a budget maneuver to accelerate GDP growth: reduce непро unproductive expenditures and increase spending on education, health care and infrastructure. This possibility is discussed, the participants in the meetings in the government and the presidential administration told in January and Interfax was confirmed by the presidential aide Andrei Belousov. The CSR suggested investing 2.3% of GDP in human capital and infrastructure. In his message to the Federal Assembly, Putin announced an increase in spending on medicine and infrastructure, just 1.5% of GDP per year would be required to fulfill the president's message, according to Belousov (quoted by Interfax) .The question is where to get the money. You can increase tax revenues by reducing the shadow sector, optimizing the cost of social support, offered the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. The first proposal after the elections will be an increase in the personal income tax (now - 13%), Bloomberg reported. During Putin's new term, reforms can be held in the social spheres - education and healthcare, as well as the pension system: first of all, retirement age, says director of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics Natalia Akindinova. She also expects reforms in the sphere of public administration - the change in the work of control and supervisory bodies and elimination of duplicative functions of ministries.

The West believes Russia was responsible for the tragedy.Voloshin, 29, was a Su-25 pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force when the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky on July 17, 2014, leading to 298 deaths.Reports in Ukraine say he was found dead at his home in Mykolayiv from a gunshot wound. A murder probe has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities although initial reports suggest he took his own life.Work colleagues reported that he had been feeling 'depressed'. His wife said she heard a gun shot and ran to him. Reports say she called police and ambulance, but a team of paramedics was unable to save his life.After the Russian accusations originally made in December 2014 , Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force and since last year was acting director of Mykolayiv International Airport.A BBC documentary in 2016 highlighted the claims which directly conflict with the official Dutch-led probe into the air horror which insists MH17 was downed by a powerful surface-to-air Buk missile shot from pro-Russian rebel held territory.Voloshin said last year: 'I did not shoot down the MH17 Boeing. A former military mate of mine called (Evgeny) Agapov, a mechanical engineer, falsely gave evidence against me.'He stressed: 'We did not carry out flights on July 17. The mechanic also say s that three aircraft went out on a mission and I was the only one to return. But again this actually happened on the 23rd.'He said that the aircraft was carrying air-to-air missiles. There were no air-to-air missiles. I was carrying air-to-surface weapons for ground targets.'Russia had claimed Agapov was a credible witness from Dnipropetrovsk air base, where both men served.Agapov alleged the Ukrainian captain went on a sortie armed with air-to-air missiles, and returned without them soon after the Boeing 777 was downed.After landing, Voloshin was 'scared', muttering that the incoming 'aircraft' - supposedly MH17 - 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time', he claimed.The Russian Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, insisted that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony was credible.SBU official Markiyan Lubkivskyi countered that Voloshin was not engaged in combat flights on July 17, the day MH17 was downed, and had not used weapons against aerial targets in the current conflict.Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17.He said: 'A great deal of evidence, including data from satellite observation, has proved that terrorist groups controlled by the Russian military shot down the passenger aircraft'.They us ed 'a Russian BUK surface-to-air-missile system', he said.But Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said: 'The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly and without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed.'He 'personally' saw Voloshin's warplane 'loaded with R-60 type air-to-air missiles, with which Su-25 fighters were not normally equipped'.His aircraft returned without these missiles.Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force in 2016 claiming that he could not afford to raise his two children on his service pay.Reports since his death said that he had admitted to feeling 'suicidal'.Police said it was normal to launch a murder probe in such circumstances.",Markin RUSSIA MALAYSIA MH17 UKRAINE SBU Mykolayiv Alexander Bastrykin Markiyan Lubkivskyi Boeing Air Force National Voloshin Vladimir Putin Evgeny Airlines Dutch Agapov International Airport

How has the situation changed for the people there? Asselborn: Tens of thousands of people have been on the run since the beginning of the Turkish offensive, causing nearly 300 civilian casualties. An additional tragedy on Syrian territory. The city of Afrin was attacked and captured with heavy weapons, although the UN had previously agreed to a ceasefire. But the Turkish President Erdogan does not feel bound by it. SPIEGEL ONLINE: Erdogan refers to the right to self-defense, which is entitled to every UN member according to Article 51 of the Charter. Aßelborn: This has nothing to do with self-defense. The borders of Syria to Turkey are hermetically sealed off. A strip of more than 20 kilometers on Syrian territory is controlled by the Turkish army. So where is the danger for Turkey? When Ankara speaks of fighting terrorists, it is a manslaughter argument. It should not be used as a free ticket to attack the territory of a neighboring country militarily - certainly not by a Nato-Land.SPIEGEL ONLINE: You have demanded in a letter to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that the North Atlantic Council with the Turkish military offensive against the Kurds in northern Syria should deal. NATO can stop the Turkish advance Asselborn: NATO is not the commander-in-chief of n President Erdogan. But it is a community of values, and as such, we should ask the rulers in Ankara how to justify that this operation is still based on Article 51 of the UN Charter. I have the biggest doubts.SPIEGEL ONLINE: What do you expect? Asselborn: Turkey must in the NATO Council to disclose their plans and procedures. Afrin is taken. And now? Is it now going further east, deeper into Syria? Turkey wants to keep Afrin occupied SPIEGEL ONLINE: US President Donald Trump has called on Turkey not to torpedo the common goal of the international community of defeating the Islamic State. Aßelborn: It's not easy for me to say so but: Trump is right. As an organization, NATO is a member of the international coalition against the ""Islamic State"". The Kurdish militia YPG supported this fight and inflicted severe defeats on IS terrorists. Not only is this struggle a priority, it is the sole purpose of the international coalition to stop these barbarians at gunpoint. It must not be that in this war-torn country a Kurdish organization like the YPG, which is not classified as a terrorist organization in Europe, America or the UN, is declared a mortal enemy.

The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent.

Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee.

It was one of the rare times the two have displayed public affection over the past few months. Scroll down for video The First Lady made her displeasure for her husband or PDA very clear last May during a trip overseas. Video of President Trump touching down in Tel Aviv showed the First Lady very clearly slapping at her husband when he tried to hold her hand at Ben Gurion Airport.Melania was walking a half-step behind her husband at the time and managed to rebuff his advance without showing any clear emotion or breaking her stride, while the commander-in-chief responded by using the rejected hand to carefully adjust his tie.It was unclear if this unexpected resistance was the result of any personal turmoil, or simply because of the carpet's narrow size. This slapping move then started popping up every few months. Melania has been showing her face far more in recent months, assuming a more active role in her duties as First Lady.She has also found herself embroiled in controversy however over her husband's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and questions about how she became an American citizen.PresidentTrump announced on August 9, 2016 at a campaign rally in North Carolina that a press conference would be held in the coming weekend to discuss how his third wife Melania Knaus became an American citizen.That press conference has yet to happen.But a little over a month later, Melania posted a letter from one of her husband's lawyers stating that she had obtained an EB-1 Visa in 2001 and through that was granted citizenship five years later, all on her own accord.This claim has left many puzzled over how Melania would qualify for what has become known as the 'Einstein Visa,' which is reserved for 'persons with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics.'Melania opted for a tweet rather than a press conference in September 2016, taking to Twitter and declaring: 'I am pleased to include a letter from my immigration attorney which states that with 100% certainty I correctly went through the legal process when arriving in the USA.'The letter, from Michael Wildes, stated that Melania first entered the United States on August 27, 1996 with a visitor visa before being granted an H-1B visa that October which allowed her to do modelling work.Wildes stated that she obtained five of those visas until in March 2001 she successfully applied for and was granted her EB-1 visa. At that time, residents of Slovenia were forced to reapply for the H-1B annually, making the EB-1 a far more convenien t option for any 'extraordinary' Slovenians.Melania was just one of six people from her country who was able to obtain an EB-1 back in 2001, making her feat all the more impressive.In order to apply for the EB-1, a foreign-born citizen must 'demonstrate extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics through sustained national or international acclaim.'Applicants must submit evidence to back their claim of 'extraordinary ability' in at least three out of ten criteria, which were outlined in the Immigration Act of 1990.These include receiving nationally or internationally recognized prizes, membership in outstanding achievement organizations, authorship of scholarly articles, commercial success and holding a critical role in distinguished organizations.It is not clear what Melania cited as evidence in her application as she has never spoken about her path to citizenship beyond posting Wildes' letter.Even if that evidence is deemed acceptable, the applicant must then prove they are 'one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor' and show sustained acclaim in their field from peers.Two months after the release of the letter it also emerged that Melania was working in the country prior to receiving her H-1B visa, with records showing she took at least 10 jobs between August and October of 1996 while still on a visitor visa.'I came here for my career, and I did so well, I moved here. It never crossed my mind to stay here without papers,' Melania said in the February 2016 issue of Harper's Bazaar.'That is just the person you are. You follow the rules. You follow the law. Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa. After a few visas, I applied for a green card and got it in 2001. After the green card, I applied for citizenship. And it was a long process.'That interview prompted Wildes to initially claim that Melania had achieved that 2001 visa through marriage, despite the fact that she and Donald did not marry until 2005 in Mar-a-Lago.Wildes then changed his tune a few months later, stating in was an EB-1 Visa that Melania got to stay in the country, which then allowed her to secure citizenship on her own.Musicians John Lennon and Yoko Ono and athletes Dirk Nowitzki and Monica Seles are a few of the famous names who have been granted EB-1 Visas",Harper Bazaar PDA Visa John Lennon Michael Wildes White House SLOVENIA Yoko Ono EU Scroll North Carolina Melania Trump Knaus Einstein Marine Stormy Daniels UNITED STATES Donald Lady EB Tel Aviv,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5518033/The-Simpsons-predict-Stephen-Hawkings-fate-19-years-early.html:  It's the cartoon comedy believed to have predictedDonald Trump's presidency, the Ebola crisis and Bengt Holmström winning the Nobel Prize.Now fans believe The Simpsons may have hinted at a greater cosmological link between physicists Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, almost two decades before Hawking would die on the day that his German counterpart was born.The eerie link was uncovered this weekend as producers aired the 1999 episode - entitled They Saved Lisa's Brain - in which Hawking stars, as a tribute to his death on Wednesday 14 March.The scene features Hawking - who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 - performing in a rap called 'A Brief History Of Rhyme' - a play on his famous volume of work.With turntables fixed to his wheelchair, his animated character is also kitted out with a gold chain, which features formula made famous by Einstein, E = mc2. The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China. The most recent prediction involved an episode from almost 20 years ago that predicted Walt Disney Co. took over 21st Century Fox Inc.The November 8, 1998 episode titled 'When You Dish Upon a Star' of the show accurately predicted that one day Disney would take over Fox. In February, it also came to light that The Simpsons predicted the USA would win curling gold and Sweden silver in Winter Olympics Curling, as part of an episode that first aired EIGHT years ago.The prediction features in the 'Boy meets Curl' episode, as Homer and Marge lead Team USA to victory.",Trumptastic Voyage Fans Century Fox Stephen Hawking Higgs Boson GERMANY Team Groening Future EU Simpsons Nicely Producer Matt Rhyme United Walt Disney Emc Nobel Prize Matt Sellman Albert Einstein Hawkings Brief History Bengt Holmström Saved Lisa Galileo Galilei Lady Gaga Ebola Awesome Bravo Dish SWEDEN Bart Trump Dan Greaney Arab Spring GREECE FIFA Hollywood Wasn Star Executive Producer Brain CHINA UNITED STATES Donald Super Bowl,"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-russia-spy-poisoning-latest-novichok-nerve-agent-programme-handover-putin-uk-a8262966.html:  The European Union has demanded that the Russian government hand over for scrutiny all information about the nerve agent that allegedly poisoned a former spy on British soil.At a meeting in Brussels on Monday the EU’s 28 foreign ministers condemned the “reckless and illegal” poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and said information about the Novichok nerve agent should be handed over to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigation.  The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",Commission UNITED KINGDOM Republic Alexander Litvinenko OPCW RUSSIA Novichok SPAIN Yulia Skripal March SWEDEN Kingdom Salisbury CZECH REPUBLIC Alfonso Dastis BELGIUM EU Convention Russ Boris Johnson Vladimir Putin SLOVAKIA Federica Mogherini Sergei UNITED STATES Chemical Weapons

""That would have absolute consequences, if we would say that as a federal government,"" said von der Leyen. Putin has clearly won the Russian presidential election on Sunday and will now remain Russia's president for another six years. The minister condemned Russia's actions in Syria. The horror there shows the ruthlessness of Russia and its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. To the poison stop on the Russian ex agent Sergej Skripal in the Great Britain of the Leyen said that all findings of the British government pointed to Russia.

This was ""after appropriate examination with great caution to consider"", said of the Leyen. Klimkin had justified his suggestion that Schröder was ""the most important lobbyist"" for Putin worldwide. Since the end of his chancellorship in 2005, Schröder has been working for Nord Stream, which operates the gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea and is majority owned by the Russian energy group Gazprom. He has been Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Russian energy company Rosneft since 2017. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas spoke at the EU Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Brussels in favor of holding talks with Putin. ""Russia will remain a difficult partner,"" Maas said. However, one needs the country to solve international conflicts. Russia's constructive contributions are expected to be ""more than just in the recent past,"" said Maas.

I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.",UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Parliament Cambridge Analytica Republican News Bannon Caribbean House Commons Mark Turnbull Zuckerberg WASHINGTON Stroz Friedberg Trump York Times Robert Mercer Stephen IDs Observer New York EU SCL Group Damian Collins Elizabeth Denham Channel Berkeley Africa UNITED STATES Elections Alexander Nix,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/hidden-camera-shows-cambridge-analytica-pitching-tricky-tactics-n857936:  In a meeting with the head of Cambridge Analytica — the political data firm used by the Trump campaign in 2016 — reporters from NBC News’ U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 News posed as potential clients interested in changing the outcome of the Sri Lankan elections.The reporters, who were trying to find out how the company operated, quickly learned about the novel and deceptive methods employed by the company, including bribes, blackmail, and misinformation campaigns. The findings were broadcast by the network on Monday.On hidden camera, the reporters recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, ""an offer he can't refuse"" or ""send some girls around to the candidate’s house.""Nix also floated the idea of spreading misinformation about politicians.""It doesn't have to be true,"" Nix said. ""It just has to be believed.""He later discussed creating fake IDs and having people pose as students or tourists as a way to further the political efforts without having its work traced back to clients.Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was also recorded by the ITN Channel 4 News reporters discussing his relationships with former British spies now working at private companies who can be contracted to gather intelligence, along with private Israeli intelligence companies.Long a company of interest in the Tru mp-Russia investigation, Cambridge Analytica came under fresh scrutiny this past weekend after the company's former director of data research, Christopher Wylie, revealed how the company had mined data from at least 50 million Facebook users.Publicly, the company advertises its ability to build ""psychographic"" profiles that can microtarget social media political advertising to people based on traits like ""extroversion"" or ""neuroticism.""The company received a $15 million investment from wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, who also funded the conservative website Breitbart while Steve Bannon — who later became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign — was at the helm.A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied to ITN Channel 4 News that it used any of the tactics discussed in the videos.“We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,"" the spokesperson sent in a statement.“Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose,” the spokesperson added.Bannon met with Nix and was interested in how the profiles could be used to change American politics, Wylie said.""Steve wanted weapons for a culture war. We offered him a way to change the culture of America,"" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. Sources familiar with Cambridge Analytica’s work on the Trump campaign say “psychographics” were not used.A source familiar with the hiring of Cambridge An alytica told NBC News that the primary figures involved in the hiring were Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, who was digital director of the Trump campaign. Parscale has denied that the firm was useful to the campaign and said the Trump campaign instead used data from the Republican National Committee.On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from buying ads or administering pages on its platform on behalf of clients, saying its data policies had been violated.""We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the claims.The developments drew rebuke from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic over the weekend.“Revelations that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired the personal, private information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission or that of Facebook, must be thoroughly investigated,"" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should appear before the panel to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its customers' data.Those calls were echoed by Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling during Brexit. In previous hearings on the topic, the social media platforms sent their general counsel or policy directors.Facebook shares slumped 8 percent Monday.",ISRAEL NBC News UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Cambridge Analytica Republican ITN Channel Mark Turnbull National Committee Brexit Long Trump Robert Mercer Senate Jared Kushner Damian Collins Steve Bannon Atlantic Political Global Wylie UNITED STATES Brad Parscale Alexander Nix,"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/19/where-is-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-cambridge-analytica-scandal:  The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices, and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unl ikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.Referencing the government’s request for Facebook’s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica’s offices, Collins tweeted: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.”The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing.",Twitter UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Cambridge Analytica Alex Stamos Stroz Friedberg UK CEOs Senate Sheryl Sandberg WheresZuck Damian Collins DeleteFacebook Ron Wyden Washington CSO Global Science Mark Zuckerberg Google Information Commissioner John Kennedy Science Research,"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/933860/UK-school-bomb-threat-evacuated-London-Northumbria-Hounslow-Tolworth:  A bomb has been placed on school grounds and will be detonated if demands are not met, the threat says.Parents have been told to collect their children immediately.More than 400 schools have been contacted across the country including London, Essex, Suffolk, Lincolnshire, Greater Manchester, Cumbria, Yorkshire, Humberside and Northumbria.The email is said to demand $5,000, giving the school three hours to send money.According to Sky News, the hoax has come about following a conflict between rival Minecraft gamers. Those involved in the feud, which centres around the Velt server operators, reportedly claimed their opponents engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. An unverified image on social media claims to show the email sent to schools saying: “The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time if you do not send $5,000.""It adds: “If you do not sent the money we will blow up the device.“If you try to call the cops we WILL blow up the device on the SPOT.

It told children to contact them if they wanted to “get out of school”.In Yorkshire, police said it had sent its Cybercrime Unit Detectives to look at the emails, and said “it is not believed there is any genuine threat”.The Met Police said eight schools were emailed in Hounslow, but it was up to the schools, not police, whether to evacuate.In Humberside, 12 schools have told police they have received the email, and have been told not to evacuate.Dowdales Secondary School in Dalton, Cumbria evacuated pupils as a precaution.Lakes College in Workington and North Lakes Primary School in Penrith also received the bomb threat in Cumbria.At least 35 schools have been affected in Northumbria, while nine were sent the threats in Lincolnshire.A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ""We have received reports from a large number of schools in our region they they have received threatening emails.""The emails inform the school that a bomb has been placed on the grounds and will be detonated if they don't hand over cash.""Detectives have looked into the emails, which appear to originate from the US, and can confirm there is no viable threat.""Schools have been visited by police to reassure them that the incident is being treated as a hoax and address any concerns.""We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and an investigation into the emails in question is underway.""A stateme nt from the Met Police said: “Police are investigating reports of communications made to a number of schools across London today, Monday, 19 March.“There have been no arrests.

The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",Commission UNITED KINGDOM Republic Alexander Litvinenko OPCW RUSSIA Novichok SPAIN Yulia Skripal March SWEDEN Kingdom Salisbury CZECH REPUBLIC Alfonso Dastis BELGIUM EU Convention Russ Boris Johnson Vladimir Putin SLOVAKIA Federica Mogherini Sergei UNITED STATES Chemical Weapons

The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",Commission UNITED KINGDOM Republic Alexander Litvinenko OPCW RUSSIA Novichok SPAIN Yulia Skripal March SWEDEN Kingdom Salisbury CZECH REPUBLIC Alfonso Dastis BELGIUM EU Convention Russ Boris Johnson Vladimir Putin SLOVAKIA Federica Mogherini Sergei UNITED STATES Chemical Weapons

On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair. And we drew attention to the Western media, which, under the influence of any lobby, make comments about the dishonesty of the elections. It's not so, ""he concluded.",Brnabic RUSSIA FRANCE POLAND Hasan Sooronbai Jeenbekov Serzh Sargsyan UKRAINE Vlad Presumably GERMANY IRAN Walter Steinmeier Angela Merkel Raul Castro EU Poroshenko Ulf Grenlund Simferopol Left Vladimir Putin Cooperation Organization Shanghai Cooperation Crimea KAZAKHSTAN Nicolas Maduro Abdel Fattah Ilham Aliyev Andreas Maurer Nursultan Nazarbayev Eli Hatem SWEDEN SERBIA Foreign Ministry Belarussian KYRGYZSTAN Xi Sisi Igor Dodon Heiko Mass Frank Walter RIA Novosti EGYPT CHINA Vučić Alexander Lukashenko ARMENIA
UNITED STATES Trump,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html:  ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a state wide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new gene ration of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priorit y in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners , and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”",Elizabeth Warren Laguna Pueblo Denise Juneau Ms Indian Andria Tupola Minnesota Legislature MeToo UNITED STATES Hawaii Washington Montana Joe Monahan House Democratic Party University North Representatives Hawaiian Native Democrat Healthcare Sharon Clahchischilliage Barack Obama Antoinette Sedillo Health Service MEXICO Deb Haaland Peggy Flanagan Trump ALBUQUERQUE Albuquerque National Congress New Ojibwe Massachusetts Republicans Mark Trahant Sedillo Lopez North Dakota Oklahoma Warfare,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-prepared-to-hit-china-with-60-billion-in-annual-tariffs/2018/03/19/fd5e5874-2bb7-11e8-b0b0-f706877db618_story.html:  President Trump is preparing to impose a package of $60 billion in annual tariffs against Chinese products, following through on a longtime threat that he says will punish China for intellectual property theft and create more U.S. jobs.The tariff package, which Trump plans to unveil by Friday, was confirmed by four senior administration officials.Senior aides had presented Trump with a $30 billion tariff package that would apply to a range of products, but Trump directed them to roughly double the scope of the new trade levies. The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets that China stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for access to its massive market.The situation remains fluid, and Trump has previously in his presidency backed off economic threats at the last minute. But he has shown a recent willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs — even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war and economists who warn such actions could ultimately hurt U.S. businesses.Trump was particularly determined to follow through on tariffs on China, as criticism of U.S.-
China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign, according to the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s plans.If implemented, the tariff package would be one of the broadest sets of economic actions imposed by a modern U.S. president agains t China and could draw retaliation, fraying the trade partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.“This looks much more like a president who is excessively eager to apply tariffs than a well-
calculated move to defend American interests,” said Phil Levy, who was a trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “There are real concerns about Chinese behavior on intellectual property, for example, but there are much more effective ways to address them.”Most U.S. businesses agree with the Trump administration’s criticisms of China. But many disagree with the administration’s strategy.“The U.S.-China Business Council believes that tariffs will do more harm than good in bringing about an improvement in intellectual property protection for American companies in China,” said John Frisbie, president of the council, a nonpartisan group of 200 U.S. companies that do business with China. “Business wants to see solutions to the issues, not just sanctions.”Other business groups endorsed the proposed tariffs. “This would be a clear indication that he’s serious about ensuring there are consequences for intellectual property violations and other ­anti-competitive practices coming from China,” said Scott Paul, president of the union-backed Alliance for American Manufacturing. “He’s not the first president who’s promised he would do something about China. But if he follows through with these tariffs, he’d be the first to ensure there are real consequences for these violations. That’s a step forward for American workers.”In 2017, China was the largest U.S. trading partner in goods
(not counting services), edging out Canada and then Mexico.
The United States exported $130.4 billion in goods to China, but it imported nearly four times as much, running a trade deficit of $375.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Economists specializing in China said that it would be difficult for the Trump administration to target Chinese companies because products imported from China are made by multinational companies with supply chains that stretch around the world.Chinese manufacturers might assemble these products or put on the finishing touches, but the country does not export as many products to the United States that are entirely made in China, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“So much of what we import from China is produced by multinational companies,” Lardy said. “Thirty percent are consumer electronics. I’m sure the president doesn’t want to raise the prices of those and send Apple’s stock into the toilet.”  It will be easier for China to hit back, Lardy said, as China can zero in on U.S. exports such as soybeans, which are entirely made in the United States. Soybeans are one of the top two goods the United States exports to China, along with aircraft and aircraft parts, according to government data.Lardy also said that penalizing China probably would not help U.S. producers, even if the tariff s succeeded in stemming the inflow of goods from China.“In the best case, they might reduce imports from China by $30 billion, but it will have virtually no effect on the U.S. global trade deficit,” he said. “We’ll just start buying things from the next lowest-cost supplier, such as Bangladesh or Vietnam. It’s not that the $30 billion will magically be produced in the United States the day after they announce these tariffs.”China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. It holds $1.17 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, down about $33.5 billion since last August. The U.S. government faces huge borrowing needs, not only to finance new deficits but also to refinance past securities now coming due, so a drop in China’s appetite for that debt could nudge interest rates up in the United States. But experts also note that China would not want to hurt the value of the huge amount of securities it still holds, leaving the two nations’ finances in a state of mutual semi-dependency.Beyond the escalating tensions with China, Trump’s pivot to protectionism has put much of the world on edge. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America first” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as the Republicans muscled tax cuts through Congress.That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.Trump earlier this month ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move U.S. allies and trading partners met with protests and threats of retaliatory tariffs. Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs and announced his resignation days before they were formally unveiled.Republican leaders in Congress criticized the metal tariffs, but the GOP is not planning legislation to overturn them. The party is also worried that Trump will withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact administration officials are renegotiating with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada.The U.S.-China Business Council noted that many states – including some swing states that propelled to an unexpected victory in 2016 – have seen sharp increases in exports to China. Over the decade ending 2016, Pennsylvania’s exports of goods to China increased 83 percent, twice the rate as its exports to the rest of the world. And Pennsylvania’s exports of services jumped more than four-fold, more than five times the pace as its services exports to the rest of the world. Exports from Michigan, another state Trump won, showed a similar pattern.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have argued China shoul d make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn’t work.Still, Trump’s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolating him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.David J.

But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",MANCHESTER RUSSIA Make Bush Justice Department Republican Flood Robert Sam Clovis John Dowd Emmet Jr Trump Donald Ms Erik Prince Mark Corallo diGenova Ethics Columbia Joe District Columbia Washington Mueller George Joseph Toensing Clinton SEYCHELLES UNITED STATES Fox News,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html:  WASHINGTON — Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.",UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Parliament Cambridge Analytica Republican News Bannon Caribbean House Commons Mark Turnbull Zuckerberg WASHINGTON Stroz Friedberg Trump York Times Robert Mercer Stephen IDs Observer New York EU SCL Group Damian Collins Elizabeth Denham Channel Berkeley Africa UNITED STATES Elections Alexander Nix,"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/trump-declares-war-on-opioid-abuse-calls-for-death-penalty-for-traffickers-more-access-for-treatment.html:  Speaking from one of the states hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, President Trump on Monday laid out a battle plan that calls for harsher sentences - and even the death penalty - for traffickers.Trump called for expanded treatment options for victims in the Manchester, N.H., speech, but leveled most of his emphasis on beefed-up enforcement. And he heaped plenty of scorn on the people he believes are responsible for as many as 42,000 U.S. deaths per year.""These are terrible people and we have to get tough with those people,"" Trump said of traffickers and dealers. ""This isn’t about committees... this is about winning a very tough problem.""""The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty,"" Trump said, before musing, ""maybe our country is not ready for that.""Trump wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain illicit opioids. The death penalty would be pursued where appropriate under current law. Justice Department says the federal death penalty is available for several limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the ""drug kingpin"" provisions in federal law.Trump reiterated an observation he has shared several times before -- that a person in the U.S. can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but that a drug dealer whose actions could lead to thousands of overdoses can spend little or no time in jail.The president said the feder al government may consider aggressive litigation against pharmaceutical companies deemed complicit in the crisis.""Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you and we will arrest you and we will hold you accountable,"" Trump said.Trump singled out Mexico and China as main sources of illicit opioids. A Drug Enforcement Administration report last year said: ""Seizures indicated that China supplies lower volumes of high-purity fentanyl, whereas fentanyl seizures from Mexico are higher volume but lower in purity.""Smuggling operations in both countries constantly try to elude U.S. officials by selling through the Internet and sending the substances – which chemists for these traffickers often alter to avoid detection – through the U.S. postal service, U.S. officials have said.Trump also announced a nationwide public awareness campaign, as well as increased research and development through public-private partnerships between the federal National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies. He announced a new website, Crisisnextdoor.gov, where people can share their stories about addiction. The hope is that horror stories will scare people away from behavior that could lead to addiction.The Trump administration aims to see the number of filled opioid prescriptions cut by one-third within three years.A third part of the plan addresses improving access to treatment and recovery p rograms that have proven effective. Many health professionals, relatives of those who have died of overdoses and people who have experienced addiction to opioids have been pushing for treatment to be a key component of any campaign to fight the epidemic.""Failure is not an option,"" the president said. ""Addiction is not our future. We will liberate our country from this crisis.""Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a recent CDC report said that the number of people checking into the emergency room after overdosing rose by 30 percent between July 2016 and September 2017.""Drug dealers show no respect for human dignity and put their own greed ahead of the safety and even the lives of others. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent and deadly business: if you want to collect a drug debt, you collect it with the barrel of a gun. As surely as night follows day, violence and death follow drug trafficking, and murder is often a tool of drug traffickers,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions reacted. ""At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.""""We cannot arrest our way out of the opioid epidemic—we tried that and ended up with an even bigger addiction problem and the world’s largest prison population,"" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, R-Ill., responded. ""The war on drugs didn’t work in the 80’s, and it won’t work now by reviving failed deterrence measures like the death penalty for drug dealers.  We must instead crack down on the over-production and over-prescribing of painkillers, and increase treatment for those suffering from addiction—both of which have bipartisan support in Congress.""Last October, Trump declared the crisis a national public health emergency, short of the national state of emergency sought by a presidential commission he put together to study the issue.Meanwhile, Congress plans to weigh a range of bills targeted at curbing the epidemic.

His Revised Standard Version (RSV) Bible was then used for the inauguration ceremony on top of the same book President Abraham Lincoln used in 1861.“My mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago,” Trump said in a campaign video from Trump Tower. “In fact it’s her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it’s just very special to me.”The future 45th president of the United States carried the Bible – which has the Trump name etched on the cover – to Sunday school classes at First Presbyterian Church in Queens, New York. His pastor and teachers also inscribed his Good Book when he graduated from Sunday school in 1955.""We are honored to add this piece of our nation's history to our growing exhibit of presidential Bibles,"" Museum of the Bible President Cary Summers said in a statement. ""It is our hope that guests will be able to learn not only about each president's unique Bible, but also about the influence this book has had on government and elected officials around the world.""The Museum of the Bible placed the Trump Bible on display in the “Bible in the World” exhibit on the second floor, alongside th e Bibles of presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush.Truman, like Trump, used his personal Bible when he was sworn in as President of the United States in 1945. Eisenhower and Bush had their Bibles opened to a Scripture during their oath. Eisenhower’s was opened to Psalm 33:12 during the inauguration in 1953, and Bush had has family Bible opened to the Beatitudes, Matthew 5:3-12 during his ceremony in 1989. His son used the same one when he became president in 2001.In addition to the presidential Bible collection, the museum features 22 other exhibits on the Bible’s impact on different subjects, from education and human rights to fashion and literature.The Museum of the Bible, located on the Washington Mall, opened its doors to the public in November with thousands of artifacts dedicated solely to the Judeo-Christian Holy Book.",Bush Museum Standard Version Trump Mall Dwight Good Book Eisenhower Washington George Tower Bibles Truman Bible Harry UNITED STATES Abraham Lincoln,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html:  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Leon RUSSIA Republican White House Bob Capitol Hill GERMANY Center Vicki Divoll Freeh Fake Memos Mike Zero Republicans Louis Michael Gary Washington Mueller Obama Andy Usually Twitter Fox News Enterprise Institute Andrew Panetta McCabe Robert WASHINGTON Bromwich Senate Intelligence Trump Lewinsky Ronald Reagan Dem Dowd James Comey Richard Nixon Clinton Schmitt Jeremy Bash Brennan UNITED STATES John Intelligence Committee,"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/hidden-camera-shows-cambridge-analytica-pitching-tricky-tactics-n857936:  In a meeting with the head of Cambridge Analytica — the political data firm used by the Trump campaign in 2016 — reporters from NBC News’ U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 News posed as potential clients interested in changing the outcome of the Sri Lankan elections.The reporters, who were trying to find out how the company operated, quickly learned about the novel and deceptive methods employed by the company, including bribes, blackmail, and misinformation campaigns. The findings were broadcast by the network on Monday.On hidden camera, the reporters recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, ""an offer he can't refuse"" or ""send some girls around to the candidate’s house.""Nix also floated the idea of spreading misinformation about politicians.""It doesn't have to be true,"" Nix said. ""It just has to be believed.""He later discussed creating fake IDs and having people pose as students or tourists as a way to further the political efforts without having its work traced back to clients.Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was also recorded by the ITN Channel 4 News reporters discussing his relationships with former British spies now working at private companies who can be contracted to gather intelligence, along with private Israeli intelligence companies.Long a company of interest in the Tru mp-Russia investigation, Cambridge Analytica came under fresh scrutiny this past weekend after the company's former director of data research, Christopher Wylie, revealed how the company had mined data from at least 50 million Facebook users.Publicly, the company advertises its ability to build ""psychographic"" profiles that can microtarget social media political advertising to people based on traits like ""extroversion"" or ""neuroticism.""The company received a $15 million investment from wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, who also funded the conservative website Breitbart while Steve Bannon — who later became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign — was at the helm.A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied to ITN Channel 4 News that it used any of the tactics discussed in the videos.“We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,"" the spokesperson sent in a statement.“Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose,” the spokesperson added.Bannon met with Nix and was interested in how the profiles could be used to change American politics, Wylie said.""Steve wanted weapons for a culture war. We offered him a way to change the culture of America,"" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. Sources familiar with Cambridge Analytica’s work on the Trump campaign say “psychographics” were not used.A source familiar with the hiring of Cambridge An alytica told NBC News that the primary figures involved in the hiring were Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, who was digital director of the Trump campaign. Parscale has denied that the firm was useful to the campaign and said the Trump campaign instead used data from the Republican National Committee.On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from buying ads or administering pages on its platform on behalf of clients, saying its data policies had been violated.""We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the claims.The developments drew rebuke from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic over the weekend.“Revelations that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired the personal, private information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission or that of Facebook, must be thoroughly investigated,"" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should appear before the panel to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its customers' data.Those calls were echoed by Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling during Brexit.

The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China. The most recent prediction involved an episode from almost 20 years ago that predicted Walt Disney Co. took over 21st Century Fox Inc.The November 8, 1998 episode titled 'When You Dish Upon a Star' of the show accurately predicted that one day Disney would take over Fox. In February, it also came to light that The Simpsons predicted the USA would win curling gold and Sweden silver in Winter Olympics Curling, as part of an episode that first aired EIGHT years ago.The prediction features in the 'Boy meets Curl' episode, as Homer and Marge lead Team USA to victory.",Trumptastic Voyage Fans Century Fox Stephen Hawking Higgs Boson GERMANY Team Groening Future EU Simpsons Nicely Producer Matt Rhyme United Walt Disney Emc Nobel Prize Matt Sellman Albert Einstein Hawkings Brief History Bengt Holmström Saved Lisa Galileo Galilei Lady Gaga Ebola Awesome Bravo Dish SWEDEN Bart Trump Dan Greaney Arab Spring GREECE FIFA Hollywood Wasn Star Executive Producer Brain CHINA UNITED STATES Donald Super Bowl
Tempe Pittsburgh Arizona,"https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/uber-165.html:  Self-driving cars should make traffic safer. But the technology is far from mature. In the US state of Arizona, an autonomous Uber car now hit a pedestrian. She died. The car had been sent to the street by the trucking agent Uber. According to the police, the self-driving car had been traveling in the city of Tempe, Arizona, where it had collided with a pedestrian. The 49-year-old succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. Behind the wheel of the Volvo XC90 Uber vehicle another person had been found, but the car was completely in self-drive mode, according to the police. Uber cooperates with the investigators to reconstruct the closer course. A spokeswoman for the Sino-Swedish company said autonomous driving technology is not Volvo's. The NHTSA and the NTSB Accident Investigation Bureau announced that they would send their own teams to Tempe. Company boss Dara Khosrowshahi told Twitter of ""incredibly sad news."" The San Francisco transport service broker said that all tests with self-driving cars in North America would be suspended. According to media reports, the company also wants to deduct its self-driving vehicles from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and the Canadian Toronto.Uber tests including in Arizona self-driving cars and trucks. It is one of several dozen American U companies, including Google's subsidiary Waymo, which tests driverless driving on shared routes. Our robotic car program was burdened with problems right from the start. On the very first day of testing in San Francisco, a Uber car was filmed driving a red traffic light and over a year ago Waymo complained that Uber used stolen robotic car technology. The lawsuit was settled recently, but weighed down the Uber program. It's not the first fatal accident involving a self-drive car. Already in 2016 an accident with a Tesla had occurred. The driver of a Tesla sports car had been in Florida and had used the self-drive mode of the vehicle. In a collision at a crossroads with a truck, the driver had died. The man apparently had his hands off the wheel at the time, though Tesla had warned that their vehicles were not yet able to fully take control of the car. Vehicles like the converted Uber cars, on the other hand, are meant to work without human involvement to drive, even if at present the security drivers often intervene. California recently also allowed the operation of robotic cars with steering wheel and pedals that are controlled solely by computer or radio. Proponents of robotic cars argue that about 90 percent of traffic accidents were due to human error and technology autonomous vehicles will prevent them in the future. However, the industry also assumes that there will be fatal accidents with self-driving cars. With information from Katharina Wilhelm, ARD Studio Los Angeles",California Toronto Company Twitter CANADA Sino Volvo Waymo Phoenix SWEDEN Dara Tesla Florida North UNITED STATES Self Tempe Katharina Wilhelm Arizona Google Pittsburgh San Francisco,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html:  SAN FRANCISCO — Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state’s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber — and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulati on. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.[Read more on how Arizona became a destination for self-driving car tests.]But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona’s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn’t reached a full floor vote.“This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America’s roads,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company’s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.”Tempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.“We needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,” Doug Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a “business-friendly and low regulatory environment” had helped the state’s economy.Even when an Uber self-driving car and another vehicle collided in Tempe in March 2017, city police and Mr. Ducey said that extra safety regulations weren’t necessary; the other driver was at fault, not the self-driving vehicle.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe’s ma yor, called Uber’s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a “responsible step” and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor “provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.”In California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine “the vehicle’s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.”Since late last year, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has been using cars without a human in the driver’s seat to pick up and drop off passengers in Arizona.Most testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called “disengage ments.”Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times — an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google’s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber’s cars have covered 3 million miles.In 2016, a man driving his Tesla using Autopilot, the car company’s self-driving feature, died on a state highway in Florida when his car crashed into a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road. Federal regulators later ruled there were no defects in the system to cause the accident.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who h as been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.“We’ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,” he said. “They’re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.”",California Toronto Elaine Herzberg Lyft Autopilot Volvo Waymo SAN FRANCISCO Silicon Valley Michael Bennett State University Florida Senate Richard Blumenthal UNITED STATES Doug Ducey Safety Cruise Tempe National Highway Traffic Ariz Sarah Abboud House Daniel Scarpinato Arizona Google Pittsburgh San Francisco Democrat Connecticut Jessica Gonzalez,"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/19/self-driving-uber-car-kills-arizona-pedestrian-police-say.html:  An Arizona woman was killed after being struck by a self-driving Uber vehicle, an incident believed to be the first of its kind.

The accident took place at Curry Road and Mill Avenue.The pedestrian, identified by police as Elaine Herzberg, 49, was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead from her injuries.Police said Herzberg was walking a bicycle across the street outside the crosswalk when she was struck.Cameras on the SUV captured video footage of the accident from both inside and outside the vehicle, Tempe Police Sgt. Ronald Elcock told reporters during a press conference Monday night.""It will definitely assist in our investigation,"" he said.The driver, who was not controlling the vehicle at the time of the accident, was identified as Rafael Vasquez, 44.Hours after the crash, Uber announced the suspension of all tests of its autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto.""Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted.

""Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.”Self-driving cars have been hailed by technology companies as the wave of the future. Autonomous cars are already being tested in more than 30 cities around the world, with companies plowing more than $80 billion into research and development.Self-driving cars work by using complex radar systems to observe the road, objects and other cars. That data is then fed into a computer that decides what the car should do next. Proponents of the technology have claimed that self-driving cars will make transportation safer.""Everyone recognized that someone was going to die in a crash involving an autonomous vehicle eventually,"" Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies risks in automated driving systems, told NBC News.""As good as that technology tries to be, mistakes can happen , or it may be one of the small fraction of crashes that cannot overcome the laws of physics and be avoided.""I just think everybody kind of hoped that one wouldn’t come this soon.""Smith added that because federal and state agencies don't have the resources to monitor individual vehicles, the onus for safety falls on the individual companies running the technology.Self-driving cars have been involved in accidents before, including in Tempe.

The autonomous taxi was operating as part of a trial that Uber hoped would represent the future, but has now been suspended.At the time of the accident, the car was driving itself in autonomous mode, Tempe police said. There was a vehicle operator behind the wheel, but they weren’t in control of the car at the time of the crash.“The vehicle was travelling northbound ... when a female walking outside of the crosswalk crossed the road from west to east when she was struck by the Uber vehicle,” police said in a statement. Officials did not make clear whether the accident had happened on Sunday night or Monday morning.The woman died in hospital and has not been named.A spokesman for Uber Technologies Inc said the company was suspending its North American tests. The company had been testing its autonomous cars in Phoenix and Tempe in Arizona, as well as a range of other cities including Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto, all of which have now been suspended.In a tweet, Uber expressed its condolences and said the company was fully cooperating with authorities. Police confirmed that Uber was helping with the investigation.“Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,” wrote Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi in a separate tweet. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with loca l law enforcement to understand what happened.”People have died in crashes involving vehicles that are driving themselves before. But this is thought to be the first time that a pedestrian has died after being hit by a self-driving vehicle.Uber’s autonomous taxis, like the self-driving cars made by other companies, use a series of sensors built into the the car to spot pedestrians, cyclists and other cars, feeding that into a computer that is able to steer and accelerate. Until recently, they have required a real person to be sat in the front of the car and ready to take over – but recently California officials approved the testing of such vehicles without humans in the front seats.Uber started trialling autonomous taxis in 2016, though they have always had human drivers sat in their front seat. The company has suggested that it sees such self-driving cars as the future of its business, potentially allowing it to have cars operate themselves rather than pay people to drive taxis.The company was forced to take the cars off the road temporarily almost a year ago, when another crash in Arizona involving the self-driving vehicles led to a major investigation. The car didn’t kill anyone in that crash but had collided with another road vehicle.The cars have also been involved in smaller issues, such as running red lights.The Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

(Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Leon RUSSIA Republican White House Bob Capitol Hill GERMANY Center Vicki Divoll Freeh Fake Memos Mike Zero Republicans Louis Michael Gary Washington Mueller Obama Andy Usually Twitter Fox News Enterprise Institute Andrew Panetta McCabe Robert WASHINGTON Bromwich Senate Intelligence Trump Lewinsky Ronald Reagan Dem Dowd James Comey Richard Nixon Clinton Schmitt Jeremy Bash Brennan UNITED STATES John Intelligence Committee,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5518033/The-Simpsons-predict-Stephen-Hawkings-fate-19-years-early.html:  It's the cartoon comedy believed to have predictedDonald Trump's presidency, the Ebola crisis and Bengt Holmström winning the Nobel Prize.Now fans believe The Simpsons may have hinted at a greater cosmological link between physicists Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, almost two decades before Hawking would die on the day that his German counterpart was born.The eerie link was uncovered this weekend as producers aired the 1999 episode - entitled They Saved Lisa's Brain - in which Hawking stars, as a tribute to his death on Wednesday 14 March.The scene features Hawking - who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 - performing in a rap called 'A Brief History Of Rhyme' - a play on his famous volume of work.With turntables fixed to his wheelchair, his animated character is also kitted out with a gold chain, which features formula made famous by Einstein, E = mc2. The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China. The most recent prediction involved an episode from almost 20 years ago that predicted Walt Disney Co. took over 21st Century Fox Inc.The November 8, 1998 episode titled 'When You Dish Upon a Star' of the show accurately predicted that one day Disney would take over Fox. In February, it also came to light that The Simpsons predicted the USA would win curling gold and Sweden silver in Winter Olympics Curling, as part of an episode that first aired EIGHT years ago.The prediction features in the 'Boy meets Curl' episode, as Homer and Marge lead Team USA to victory.",Trumptastic Voyage Fans Century Fox Stephen Hawking Higgs Boson GERMANY Team Groening Future EU Simpsons Nicely Producer Matt Rhyme United Walt Disney Emc Nobel Prize Matt Sellman Albert Einstein Hawkings Brief History Bengt Holmström Saved Lisa Galileo Galilei Lady Gaga Ebola Awesome Bravo Dish SWEDEN Bart Trump Dan Greaney Arab Spring GREECE FIFA Hollywood Wasn Star Executive Producer Brain CHINA UNITED STATES Donald Super Bowl
UNITED STATES North,"https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/uber-165.html:  Self-driving cars should make traffic safer. But the technology is far from mature. In the US state of Arizona, an autonomous Uber car now hit a pedestrian. She died. The car had been sent to the street by the trucking agent Uber. According to the police, the self-driving car had been traveling in the city of Tempe, Arizona, where it had collided with a pedestrian. The 49-year-old succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. Behind the wheel of the Volvo XC90 Uber vehicle another person had been found, but the car was completely in self-drive mode, according to the police. Uber cooperates with the investigators to reconstruct the closer course. A spokeswoman for the Sino-Swedish company said autonomous driving technology is not Volvo's. The NHTSA and the NTSB Accident Investigation Bureau announced that they would send their own teams to Tempe. Company boss Dara Khosrowshahi told Twitter of ""incredibly sad news."" The San Francisco transport service broker said that all tests with self-driving cars in North America would be suspended. According to media reports, the company also wants to deduct its self-driving vehicles from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and the Canadian Toronto.Uber tests including in Arizona self-driving cars and trucks. It is one of several dozen American U companies, including Google's subsidiary Waymo, which tests driverless driving on shared routes. Our robotic car program was burdened with problems right from the start. On the very first day of testing in San Francisco, a Uber car was filmed driving a red traffic light and over a year ago Waymo complained that Uber used stolen robotic car technology. The lawsuit was settled recently, but weighed down the Uber program. It's not the first fatal accident involving a self-drive car. Already in 2016 an accident with a Tesla had occurred. The driver of a Tesla sports car had been in Florida and had used the self-drive mode of the vehicle. In a collision at a crossroads with a truck, the driver had died. The man apparently had his hands off the wheel at the time, though Tesla had warned that their vehicles were not yet able to fully take control of the car. Vehicles like the converted Uber cars, on the other hand, are meant to work without human involvement to drive, even if at present the security drivers often intervene. California recently also allowed the operation of robotic cars with steering wheel and pedals that are controlled solely by computer or radio. Proponents of robotic cars argue that about 90 percent of traffic accidents were due to human error and technology autonomous vehicles will prevent them in the future. However, the industry also assumes that there will be fatal accidents with self-driving cars. With information from Katharina Wilhelm, ARD Studio Los Angeles",California Toronto Company Twitter CANADA Sino Volvo Waymo Phoenix SWEDEN Dara Tesla Florida North UNITED STATES Self Tempe Katharina Wilhelm Arizona Google Pittsburgh San Francisco,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-prepared-to-hit-china-with-60-billion-in-annual-tariffs/2018/03/19/fd5e5874-2bb7-11e8-b0b0-f706877db618_story.html:  President Trump is preparing to impose a package of $60 billion in annual tariffs against Chinese products, following through on a longtime threat that he says will punish China for intellectual property theft and create more U.S. jobs.The tariff package, which Trump plans to unveil by Friday, was confirmed by four senior administration officials.Senior aides had presented Trump with a $30 billion tariff package that would apply to a range of products, but Trump directed them to roughly double the scope of the new trade levies. The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets that China stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for access to its massive market.The situation remains fluid, and Trump has previously in his presidency backed off economic threats at the last minute. But he has shown a recent willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs — even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war and economists who warn such actions could ultimately hurt U.S. businesses.Trump was particularly determined to follow through on tariffs on China, as criticism of U.S.-
China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign, according to the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s plans.If implemented, the tariff package would be one of the broadest sets of economic actions imposed by a modern U.S. president agains t China and could draw retaliation, fraying the trade partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.“This looks much more like a president who is excessively eager to apply tariffs than a well-
calculated move to defend American interests,” said Phil Levy, who was a trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “There are real concerns about Chinese behavior on intellectual property, for example, but there are much more effective ways to address them.”Most U.S. businesses agree with the Trump administration’s criticisms of China. But many disagree with the administration’s strategy.“The U.S.-China Business Council believes that tariffs will do more harm than good in bringing about an improvement in intellectual property protection for American companies in China,” said John Frisbie, president of the council, a nonpartisan group of 200 U.S. companies that do business with China. “Business wants to see solutions to the issues, not just sanctions.”Other business groups endorsed the proposed tariffs. “This would be a clear indication that he’s serious about ensuring there are consequences for intellectual property violations and other ­anti-competitive practices coming from China,” said Scott Paul, president of the union-backed Alliance for American Manufacturing. “He’s not the first president who’s promised he would do something about China. But if he follows through with these tariffs, he’d be the first to ensure there are real consequences for these violations. That’s a step forward for American workers.”In 2017, China was the largest U.S. trading partner in goods
(not counting services), edging out Canada and then Mexico.
The United States exported $130.4 billion in goods to China, but it imported nearly four times as much, running a trade deficit of $375.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Economists specializing in China said that it would be difficult for the Trump administration to target Chinese companies because products imported from China are made by multinational companies with supply chains that stretch around the world.Chinese manufacturers might assemble these products or put on the finishing touches, but the country does not export as many products to the United States that are entirely made in China, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“So much of what we import from China is produced by multinational companies,” Lardy said. “Thirty percent are consumer electronics. I’m sure the president doesn’t want to raise the prices of those and send Apple’s stock into the toilet.”  It will be easier for China to hit back, Lardy said, as China can zero in on U.S. exports such as soybeans, which are entirely made in the United States. Soybeans are one of the top two goods the United States exports to China, along with aircraft and aircraft parts, according to government data.Lardy also said that penalizing China probably would not help U.S. producers, even if the tariff s succeeded in stemming the inflow of goods from China.“In the best case, they might reduce imports from China by $30 billion, but it will have virtually no effect on the U.S. global trade deficit,” he said. “We’ll just start buying things from the next lowest-cost supplier, such as Bangladesh or Vietnam. It’s not that the $30 billion will magically be produced in the United States the day after they announce these tariffs.”China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. It holds $1.17 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, down about $33.5 billion since last August. The U.S. government faces huge borrowing needs, not only to finance new deficits but also to refinance past securities now coming due, so a drop in China’s appetite for that debt could nudge interest rates up in the United States. But experts also note that China would not want to hurt the value of the huge amount of securities it still holds, leaving the two nations’ finances in a state of mutual semi-dependency.Beyond the escalating tensions with China, Trump’s pivot to protectionism has put much of the world on edge. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America first” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as the Republicans muscled tax cuts through Congress.That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.Trump earlier this month ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move U.S. allies and trading partners met with protests and threats of retaliatory tariffs. Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs and announced his resignation days before they were formally unveiled.Republican leaders in Congress criticized the metal tariffs, but the GOP is not planning legislation to overturn them. The party is also worried that Trump will withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact administration officials are renegotiating with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada.The U.S.-China Business Council noted that many states – including some swing states that propelled to an unexpected victory in 2016 – have seen sharp increases in exports to China. Over the decade ending 2016, Pennsylvania’s exports of goods to China increased 83 percent, twice the rate as its exports to the rest of the world. And Pennsylvania’s exports of services jumped more than four-fold, more than five times the pace as its services exports to the rest of the world. Exports from Michigan, another state Trump won, showed a similar pattern.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have argued China shoul d make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn’t work.Still, Trump’s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolating him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.David J.

The autonomous taxi was operating as part of a trial that Uber hoped would represent the future, but has now been suspended.At the time of the accident, the car was driving itself in autonomous mode, Tempe police said. There was a vehicle operator behind the wheel, but they weren’t in control of the car at the time of the crash.“The vehicle was travelling northbound ... when a female walking outside of the crosswalk crossed the road from west to east when she was struck by the Uber vehicle,” police said in a statement. Officials did not make clear whether the accident had happened on Sunday night or Monday morning.The woman died in hospital and has not been named.A spokesman for Uber Technologies Inc said the company was suspending its North American tests. The company had been testing its autonomous cars in Phoenix and Tempe in Arizona, as well as a range of other cities including Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto, all of which have now been suspended.In a tweet, Uber expressed its condolences and said the company was fully cooperating with authorities. Police confirmed that Uber was helping with the investigation.“Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,” wrote Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi in a separate tweet. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with loca l law enforcement to understand what happened.”People have died in crashes involving vehicles that are driving themselves before. But this is thought to be the first time that a pedestrian has died after being hit by a self-driving vehicle.Uber’s autonomous taxis, like the self-driving cars made by other companies, use a series of sensors built into the the car to spot pedestrians, cyclists and other cars, feeding that into a computer that is able to steer and accelerate. Until recently, they have required a real person to be sat in the front of the car and ready to take over – but recently California officials approved the testing of such vehicles without humans in the front seats.Uber started trialling autonomous taxis in 2016, though they have always had human drivers sat in their front seat. The company has suggested that it sees such self-driving cars as the future of its business, potentially allowing it to have cars operate themselves rather than pay people to drive taxis.The company was forced to take the cars off the road temporarily almost a year ago, when another crash in Arizona involving the self-driving vehicles led to a major investigation. The car didn’t kill anyone in that crash but had collided with another road vehicle.The cars have also been involved in smaller issues, such as running red lights.The Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state.

The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum.

He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel.

The incumbent president received 77% of the votes cast by the electors who took part in the elections, and more than 50% - from the total payroll structure, after processing 99.9% of the ballots. This happens in Russia for the first time. The population supports Putin's foreign and domestic policies, and there is no alternative candidate, analysts of Alfa Bank state. The powerful support of the population gives the president the mandate for economic reforms - but he is unlikely to use them, they believe. After the elections, the government will focus on budgetary policy, and structural reforms will push back into the background, the note by Alfa Bank notes. But the support of voters can strengthen Russia's attempts to challenge the dominant role of the United States in the world, analysts believe. Analysts believe that it is not possible to interpret the results of the election so unambiguously, says Kirill Tremasov, director of the analytical department of Loko-Investa: the main task for the next term is to revive the economy. Without solving this problem, Putin's nuclear electorate can significantly reduce, the expert continues. ""He was forgiven for the economic failure in these six years for the Crimea, which divided people with liberal views on the economy in two, no matter what they said, but this electorate in large cities is estimated at tens of percent,"" Tremasov argues. But another six years of stagnation would be a very difficult test for the population. Nevertheless, now the task of reviving the economy is most likely to be considered without serious structural reforms (courts, state regulation, privatization) and the main emphasis will be placed on credit stimulation of economic growth, Tremasov said. ""In the short term, this can give a positive result, and then interest in structural reforms will really disappear completely,"" he believes. As a rule, the ""window of opportunities"" for reforms opens immediately after the elections, noted the head of the Economic Expert Group Evsei Gurvich: the elected leader receives a mandate even for unpopular reforms. On the eve of the third term, Putin had already proposed a program of reforms, the main tasks of which included his May decrees. For example, he instructed by 2018 to increase investments to 27% of GDP, and labor productivity - by 1.5 times, to raise Russia in the World Bank rating on the conditions of doing business from 120th to 20th place, to increase real wages in 1 , 4-1.5 times, salaries of teachers, doctors and scientists - up to 100-200% of the average for the region. But after the elections, the incentives for reforms were weakened by high oil prices, and then the events in Ukraine and sanctions followed, priorities changed, Gurvich said: it was necessary to restore macroeconomic stability, and geopolitics came to the fore. These presidential elections were exceptional in that, that the winning candidate did not set out an economic program at all, Economist of the BCS Vladimir Tikhomirov: there were no program statements, and from the clarifications of the future agenda Putin did not dodge at all. But he links it to the fact that after the election, Putin will take unpopular measures - the president received a very strong mandate of trust. Now there are many fundamental problems that need to be addressed: to change the structure of the economy, reform the pension system, and improve the demographic situation, Tikhomirov lists: without reforms, the economy can not grow faster. Indicative will be the composition of the government - whether Putin will appoint reformers or leave the previous team, he concludes. Changes in the government will occur after the inauguration, Putin said on Sunday after the election. Last week Putin again instructed the government to ensure the growth rate of the Russian economy is higher than the world level. Russia's economy is returning to cyclical growth, but without structural reforms it will be low - about 1.5-2 % per year, was noted in the economic monitoring of the Russian Academy of Science and Technology. Three key reform strategies were discussed: the Ministry of Economic Development proposes to stake on the growth of investments, non-primary exports and labor productivity, the Center for Strategic Research (TsSR) Alexei Kudrin - on the growth of aggregate factor productivity and investments in the most productive sectors, the Stolypin Club of the business ombudsman Boris Titov - to support a moderately weak exchange rate and stimulate demand for import substitution. Kudrin proposed a budget maneuver to accelerate GDP growth: reduce непро unproductive expenditures and increase spending on education, health care and infrastructure. This possibility is discussed, the participants in the meetings in the government and the presidential administration told in January and Interfax was confirmed by the presidential aide Andrei Belousov. The CSR suggested investing 2.3% of GDP in human capital and infrastructure. In his message to the Federal Assembly, Putin announced an increase in spending on medicine and infrastructure, just 1.5% of GDP per year would be required to fulfill the president's message, according to Belousov (quoted by Interfax) .The question is where to get the money. You can increase tax revenues by reducing the shadow sector, optimizing the cost of social support, offered the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. The first proposal after the elections will be an increase in the personal income tax (now - 13%), Bloomberg reported. During Putin's new term, reforms can be held in the social spheres - education and healthcare, as well as the pension system: first of all, retirement age, says director of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics Natalia Akindinova. She also expects reforms in the sphere of public administration - the change in the work of control and supervisory bodies and elimination of duplicative functions of ministries. But without serious changes in the business climate and a decline in the state's share in the economy, it is not possible to increase the growth of investments in fixed assets, as Putin entrusted, and Akindinov is skeptical. By the long-term forecast of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics, by the end of Putin's new term, the growth rate of the economy will remain at the level of 2%.",BCS RUSSIA Higher School UKRAINE Group Evsei Center Akindinov Technology GDP Andrei Belousov Anton Siluanov Natalia Akindinova School Economics Alfa Bank Development Economic Expert World Expert Group Strategic Economics Natalia Tikhomirov Alexei Kudrin Vladimir Putin Academy Interfax Ministry Evsei Gurvich Boris Titov Kirill Tremasov,"https://russian.rt.com/opinion/493917-petrovskiy-voskreshenie-spravedlivosti:  At Alexanderplatz, the central square of East Berlin, ""under the clock"" (the main meeting place, something like ""near the Lenin monument"" in the Russian provincial city), yesterday a small company of compatriots gathered. I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal.

Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

The West believes Russia was responsible for the tragedy.Voloshin, 29, was a Su-25 pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force when the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky on July 17, 2014, leading to 298 deaths.Reports in Ukraine say he was found dead at his home in Mykolayiv from a gunshot wound. A murder probe has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities although initial reports suggest he took his own life.Work colleagues reported that he had been feeling 'depressed'. His wife said she heard a gun shot and ran to him. Reports say she called police and ambulance, but a team of paramedics was unable to save his life.After the Russian accusations originally made in December 2014 , Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force and since last year was acting director of Mykolayiv International Airport.A BBC documentary in 2016 highlighted the claims which directly conflict with the official Dutch-led probe into the air horror which insists MH17 was downed by a powerful surface-to-air Buk missile shot from pro-Russian rebel held territory.Voloshin said last year: 'I did not shoot down the MH17 Boeing. A former military mate of mine called (Evgeny) Agapov, a mechanical engineer, falsely gave evidence against me.'He stressed: 'We did not carry out flights on July 17. The mechanic also say s that three aircraft went out on a mission and I was the only one to return. But again this actually happened on the 23rd.'He said that the aircraft was carrying air-to-air missiles. There were no air-to-air missiles. I was carrying air-to-surface weapons for ground targets.'Russia had claimed Agapov was a credible witness from Dnipropetrovsk air base, where both men served.Agapov alleged the Ukrainian captain went on a sortie armed with air-to-air missiles, and returned without them soon after the Boeing 777 was downed.After landing, Voloshin was 'scared', muttering that the incoming 'aircraft' - supposedly MH17 - 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time', he claimed.The Russian Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, insisted that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony was credible.SBU official Markiyan Lubkivskyi countered that Voloshin was not engaged in combat flights on July 17, the day MH17 was downed, and had not used weapons against aerial targets in the current conflict.Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17.He said: 'A great deal of evidence, including data from satellite observation, has proved that terrorist groups controlled by the Russian military shot down the passenger aircraft'.They us ed 'a Russian BUK surface-to-air-missile system', he said.But Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said: 'The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly and without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed.'He 'personally' saw Voloshin's warplane 'loaded with R-60 type air-to-air missiles, with which Su-25 fighters were not normally equipped'.His aircraft returned without these missiles.Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force in 2016 claiming that he could not afford to raise his two children on his service pay.Reports since his death said that he had admitted to feeling 'suicidal'.Police said it was normal to launch a murder probe in such circumstances.",Markin RUSSIA MALAYSIA MH17 UKRAINE SBU Mykolayiv Alexander Bastrykin Markiyan Lubkivskyi Boeing Air Force National Voloshin Vladimir Putin Evgeny Airlines Dutch Agapov International Airport,"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-russia-spy-poisoning-latest-novichok-nerve-agent-programme-handover-putin-uk-a8262966.html:  The European Union has demanded that the Russian government hand over for scrutiny all information about the nerve agent that allegedly poisoned a former spy on British soil.At a meeting in Brussels on Monday the EU’s 28 foreign ministers condemned the “reckless and illegal” poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and said information about the Novichok nerve agent should be handed over to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigation.  The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",Commission UNITED KINGDOM Republic Alexander Litvinenko OPCW RUSSIA Novichok SPAIN Yulia Skripal March SWEDEN Kingdom Salisbury CZECH REPUBLIC Alfonso Dastis BELGIUM EU Convention Russ Boris Johnson Vladimir Putin SLOVAKIA Federica Mogherini Sergei UNITED STATES Chemical Weapons

He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT. In this connection, he believes that the Ukrainian minister is only trying to warm up interest in his country.",Rosneft Middle East RUSSIA LATVIA Higher School Pavel Klimkin WSJ UKRAINE Nord Stream Merkel GERMANY Center International Studies Wall Street Dmitry Abzalov Timothy Bordachev Comprehensive EU Trojan UNITED STATES ESTONIA Street Journal Eastern Schröder Strategic Communications Gerhard Schroeder Despite Bild,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html:  As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.The impending exit of that executive — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer — reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controv ersy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, accord ing to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook i nitially denied.By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust, ’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”",Tavis McGinn RUSSIA Democratic National Munich Alex Stamos Capitol Hill National Committee Center Yahoo Pedro Canahuati Honest Data Sheryl Sandberg DNC Sandy Parakilas Senator Elliot Schrage Clinton Warner Virginia Mark Zuckerberg UNITED STATES San Francisco Democrat Humane Technology,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html:  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Leon RUSSIA Republican White House Bob Capitol Hill GERMANY Center Vicki Divoll Freeh Fake Memos Mike Zero Republicans Louis Michael Gary Washington Mueller Obama Andy Usually Twitter Fox News Enterprise Institute Andrew Panetta McCabe Robert WASHINGTON Bromwich Senate Intelligence Trump Lewinsky Ronald Reagan Dem Dowd James Comey Richard Nixon Clinton Schmitt Jeremy Bash Brennan UNITED STATES John Intelligence Committee
