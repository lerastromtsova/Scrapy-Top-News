Two non-detonated in the course of the US attack on April 14 cruise missiles, found by the Syrian military in good condition, were sent by air to Russia on April 18. ""Two cruise missiles that did not explode during the US missile strike in Syria on the night of April 14 were discovered by the Syrian military, both missiles in good enough condition the day before yesterday [April 17] were transferred to the Russian ""the source said, according to him,"" these missiles were sent by air to Russia yesterday [April 18]. ""TASS does not have an official confirmation of this information from the Russian side. US President Donald Trump 11 ap relying in his microblog on Twitter, said about possible strikes against Syria with new ""smart"" missiles. The impact was caused by ships and bombers of the United States, Britain and France on April 14. In total, 103 military cruise missiles were calculated, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71 of them. The main targets, the Russian military department notes, are military facilities in Syria, in particular, several air bases. The cause for the attack was the statements of the so-called White Helmets and a number of non-governmental organizations about the alleged use by Damascus of chemical weapons - bombs with chlorine - in the city of Duma. According to Russian specialists who visited the site, no traces of poisonous substances and injured from them were found. Moscow called statements about the Khimatka and the accompanying stenuyuschie video clips staged and provoked. In the near future, the experts of the OPCW, who arrived in Syria, should check the information on the Khimatak in the Duma.",White Donald Trump FRANCE Khimatak TASS Duma SYRIA UNITED STATES Ministry Defense UNITED KINGDOM OPCW RUSSIA,"https://russian.rt.com/world/article/504868-ssha-rossiya-udar-rakety:  The Congressional Research Center published a report on possible problems associated with the concept of a rapid global strike. In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments. In a number of countries, Washington's actions have caused outrage. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the US missile strikes aggression against a sovereign state. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the strikes on the SAR illegal. He criticized the actions of Washington and China - another permanent member of the UN Security Council, where the situation in Syria was discussed.",New York East Gut James Mattis Wall Street Great Lavrov Bush POLAND Viktor Murakhovsky George Vladimir Putin USSR IRAN Washington SAR Security Council CHINA Ministry Defense Alexei Leonkov UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Emelianov North Trump SYRIA Street Journal Expert Pentagon,"https://vz.ru/opinions/2018/4/19/918552.html:  In Armenia, there is a new attempt at a ""velvet revolution"" with all the usual attributes, including anti-Russian slogans. This has once again actualized the public debate in Russia - though much more sluggish than usual - about its policy in the post-Soviet countries. Actually, the main the claim to the Kremlin is obvious: why does he continue to walk on the rake and is not able to work with civil society in the former Soviet republics? As a result, the initiative is owned by the West, which successfully fuels the anti-Russian sentiment which allows it to launch destructive processes, often change power and, as a consequence, the state policy - to pro-Western, pro-American, pro-NATO, etc. In this regard, the main criticism is Rossotrudnichestvo and other state structures whose mission is work with compatriots abroad and which have become a symbol of senseless get-togethers and cutting budgetary funds. True, it is very revealing that this time such reproaches sound less frequent and quieter, but all the time e stumble upon a tough resistance in diskussiyah.Fakticheski becoming increasingly common public reaction in Russia, which boils down to the question: why Russia should even work with the public on the post-Soviet space? Why should she persuade someone and persuade in some way, if people do not go on for many examples (from Libya to Ukraine), what are such games played under the conductor Many perceptive analysts have repeatedly pointed out the reasons why the Kremlin is leading such a deliberately ineffective policy towards the post-Soviet civil society. They are very diverse, but the two key ones lie on the surface. Firstly, Russia can not yet compete with the West for the minds of the public both for purely financial moments and for meaningful ones. Until recently, Russia, even for itself, did not have an attractive image of its own and the image of its future. Now it has appeared, but it obviously can not compete on the ""foreign markets"" with the ""American dream"" or ""Western democracy"". Just did not gain enough strength. In this situation, counting on effective work with foreign civil society is simply not serious, if not silly. And spending money on it is like letting them go. And secondly, and even more important, any actions that strengthen Russia's position in the societies of neighboring countries are extremely painful (if not to say disgraced) perceived by the authorities and elites of these states . And this applies to even the most friendly to Moscow. Regular news is coming from Belarus and Kazakhstan. The same Armenia signed an association with the EU, emphasizing its diversity. The list can be continued. Indeed, in recent years this trend has increased significantly. It is hardly a big exaggeration to assume that this is directly related to the first point. In Russia, rivlekatelny project and the image itself, and he begins to attract public sympathy post-Soviet societies simply on the fact of its existence, even without the concerted efforts Moskvy.A elite of neighboring countries perceive this as a threat to themselves and to the independence of their countries - and are taking steps to distance from a neighbor historically has enormous attracting to itself siloy.Kak and was told all these considerations have repeatedly voiced in political diskussiyah.Odnako can see Mr. and the situation more deeply (and cynical), and then appear for at least another two factors that explain the calm and indifferent position of Russia in the first place sobytiyah.Obstoyatelstvo - global geopolitical igra.Yavlyaetsya obvious that the West creates a tension belt around Russia in the territory closest to her neighbors , with which Moscow has a historical and profound interdependence. They are either pulled by a pro-Western, anti-Russian ""umbrella"" or simply destabiliziruyutsya.Lyubopytnym is that the Kremlin has in recent years ceased to resist this policy, giving the events an opportunity to develop virtually without his vmeshatelstva.Sudya around, the reason lies in the fact that the expenditure of effort and the resources for this are considered inexpedient. Instead, Moscow put into service concept of ""besieged fortress"" .Nyneshnyaya state border of Russia became the main line of defense in every way - without the traditional rossiyskog about dispersing forces on neighbors as a zone of influence. Russia is rapidly replacing all of Russia's critical dependencies on them - economic, military ... All.Moscow is ready to provide them with some help (if they are sensible), but for any attempts at blackmail and pressure, whether the current authorities or the victory of another ""color revolution "", there will simply be"" rehashing hatches "", and these countries will be left to their fate. Russia cut off Ukraine from itself. Someone seriously believes that after that the military base in Gyumri or Baikonur cosmodrome will become serious arguments for pressure on the Kremlin? From the 20th century, Russia inherited special relations with the former Soviet republics: an equal partnership with the psychological subtleties generated by what is commonly called ""brotherly relations ""However, Moscow is annoyed with this state of affairs. It does not need"" fraternal ""subtleties, and partnership is not equal, but in accordance with the real weight of each side. Moreover, the fact that Russia is trying to use arguments that neighboring countries received thanks to it (high-tech industries, important military facilities, developed infrastructure, etc.) adds discontent. But the problem is gradually being solved by itself. In most post-Soviet countries, faster or slower, but technological and infrastructure degradation is taking place. Moreover, Moscow does not even need to do anything. For example, one can only assume how severe a blow in this sense will be a translation into the Kazakh alphabet language. The accelerated transformation of Ukraine from a highly industrialized country into an industrially backward territory can be observed live. The irony is that Russia, despite the known problems, is completely satisfied with all these processes, since they ultimately lead to the desired result, where it will be a brilliant highly developed metropolis , surrounded by backward and dependent countries, which are convenient for her sales markets. And as for possible costs in the form of anti-Russian policy, practice shows that everything has been resolved Amo and nothing is eternal. Georgia will not let you lie. Yes, and Ukraine too. The fight with the aggressor there, of course, is uncompromising, but only trade between the countries last year increased by tens of percent. Moreover, the structure of goods varies, and the surplus of trade balance in favor of Russia is twofold.",UKRAINE Soviet NATO Regular ARMENIA BELARUS LIBYA KAZAKHSTAN UNITED STATES Gyumri Baikonur RUSSIA,"https://vz.ru/news/2018/4/19/918600.html:  It is always interesting to see the electronics, algorithms and techniques of American cruise missiles, Sergey Denisentsev, an expert at AST Center, told VZGLYAD, commenting on the transfer by the Syrians of Russia of two unexploded US missiles. Moreover, the Americans do not sell Tomahawks for export: ""Such weapons usually have a self-liquidation system in case of an abnormal situation, in which there is no defeat of the target,"" said Sergei Denisentsev, an expert at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. Perhaps the missiles remained intact, because this system for some reason did not work or it was not at all. Denisentsev considers it useful to obtain samples of such weapons. ""It's just that you can not buy cruise missiles on the market. It is always interesting to see the electronics, the algorithms of this weapon and the technique itself.

Alexander Shulgin, Russia's permanent representative to the OPCW: ""We first asked a key question to the head of the ministry: is it really true, according to the British, that based on the results of the OPCW expertise, can we judge the country of the toxic chemical used? And we got an absolutely clear unambiguous answer: no, this is not possible. It is not possible to establish, according to the results of the analysis, where the thread stretches, to which country.

Nevertheless, at a meeting of the organization in The Hague, the representative of Great Britain insisted that once the conclusions of experts coincided with the conclusions of the British special services, it means that the investigation decided correctly: ""Novice"" came to Salisbury from Russia, nowhere else. But Russian experts believe that not everything is so unambiguous. Three years ago, a patent for the ""Newbie"" was registered in the United States, where the substance was produced. Documents on this have now been submitted to the OPCW Executive Board.

The debate about the ""Novice"" continued in New York. Britain called the Council Safely to report on the findings of the OPCW expert commission, but instead of the facts, the country's permanent representative operated on ""competent opinion"".

In response, Russia's permanent representative Vasily Nebenzia asked to clarify whether allegations of Russia's involvement in the Salisbury incident - with no evidence at all - are pressure on the British investigation.

Schneiderman of New York is moving to change New York state law so that he and other local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to President Trump who have been pardoned, according to a letter Mr. Schneiderman sent to the governor and state lawmakers on Wednesday.The move, if approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Legislature, would serve notice that the legal troubles of the president and his aides may continue without the efforts of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Under the plan, Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, seeks to exempt New York’s double jeopardy law from cases involving presidential pardons, according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The current law and the concept of double jeopardy in general mean that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice.Right now, New York state law prevents people from being prosecuted more than once for crimes related to the same act, even if the original prosecution was in federal court. There are already a number of exceptions to the law, and the letter says that Mr. Schneiderman is proposing to add a new one that could be used if federal pardons are issued.Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman have a contentious past. Mr. Schneiderman led a three-year investigation of Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. For his part, the president has dubbed Mr. Schneiderman “the nation’s worst AG.” He has also called him a “lightweight” and a “total loser,” and even tweeted that he wore eyeliner.While Mr. Schneiderman’s jurisdiction does not encompass many of the areas being investigated by Mr. Mueller, a president has no authority to commute sentences or pardon offenses at the state level. That leaves convictions obtained by the state attorney general’s office or any other local prosecutor outside the president’s ability to intervene. The proposal would be structured so that it would not affect people who sought clemency after long jail sentences, an aide to Mr. Schneiderman said.If the proposed law is passed, anyone indicted on state charges after being convicted in federal court and then pardoned would likely challenge the state law in court. But Mr. Schneiderman wrote in the letter that he and his advisers were confident the legislation would withstand any constitutional scrutiny.Even though New York is a reliably blue state, Mr. Schneiderman’s proposal is hardly a foregone conclusion, given the narrow political divide in the State Senate.“We are disturbed by reports that the president is considering pardons of individuals who may have committed serious federal financial, tax, and other crimes — acts that may also violate New York law,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement provided by his office.“We must ensure that if the president, or any president, issues such pardons, we can use the full force of New York’s l aws to bring such individuals to justice.”The White House declined to comment.The president has openly discussed his pardon powers, and reportedly even asked his aides whether he could pardon himself, though one of his lawyers denied it.“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon,” he tweeted last year, “why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.”Just last week, when lawyers for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who is himself the subject of a criminal investigation apparently unrelated to Mr. Mueller’s probe, were in court clashing with prosecutors over a search warrant, Mr. Trump pardoned former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr.Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and a frequent Fox News commentator, said after reading Mr. Schneiderman’s letter that his proposal raises constitutional questions that cannot be answered without examining the legislation.“The first is the specificity of the statute — of the exception — focusing on a limited number of people,” he said, noting that legislatures cannot make laws that apply to specific individuals. But he added that it was possible that such legislation, if properly drawn, would be constitutional.Mr. Schneiderman’s move could set off a battle in the State Senate, where Republicans have narrowly controlled the chamber through alliances with Democrats. Earlier this month, though, most Democrats in the chamber ended a long- running feud, which has left a degree of doubt over long-term control of the body. An April 24 special election in Westchester County could determine who will lead the chamber.The measure would likely be supported by Mr. Cuomo, who is tacking left in the face of a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist. The state’s Assembly has long been a bulwark of liberal ideals.State Senator Todd D. Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said in a statement that he would introduce a bill to “close the glaring loophole” highlighted by Mr. Schneiderman’s letter. Similar legislation will be introduced in the Assembly.Mr. Schneiderman’s move is likely to inflame allies of Mr. Trump, who see Mr. Schneiderman as an opportunist bent on making political hay, and whom they see as unlikely to treat Mr. Trump fairly.This is hardly the first time Mr. Schneiderman has challenged Mr. Trump.A month before the 2016 election, his office ordered Mr. Trump’s foundation to stop raising money in New York amid scrutiny over Mr. Trump’s claims about charitable giving. The $25 million settlement over Trump University came shortly after the election. Mr. Schneiderman called the settlement “a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”The attorney general’s office has also investigated Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, who was indicted on federal charges last year, though he deferred his inquiry amid t he federal investigation.The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution has a double jeopardy clause that says “nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” But that applies to multiple prosecutions of the same federal offense.The states are almost evenly split between those that have additional double jeopardy protections at the state level and those that do not. And Mr. Schneiderman has successfully backed changes to the double jeopardy law before. In 2011, the state closed what was known as the “Helmsley loophole,” named for the headline-grabbing hotelier Leona Helmsley, allowing it to prosecute tax cheats who had already been prosecuted federally.“New York’s statutory protections could result in the unintended and unjust consequence of insulating someone pardoned for serious federal crimes from subsequent prosecution for state crimes,” Mr. Schneiderman writes in his letter, “even if that person was never tried or convicted in federal court, and never served a single day in federal prison.”Whether Mr. Schneiderman’s office would even seek to become involved in a criminal prosecution of Mr. Trump or his aides remains to be seen. But his move only adds to Mr. Trump’s legal problems.Several of Mr. Trump’s former aides have pleaded guilty in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, including Rick Gates, a former campaign adviser, and Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser. Earlier this month, the Southern District of New York, an office of the Justice Department outside of Mr. Mueller’s, revealed it was investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Trump has made his feelings about these investigations plain in a recent tweet that said, simply, “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”",New York Fifth Amendment Lewis Libby TOTAL Leona Libby Jr Flynn Mueller Alan Helmsley Harvard Law Law School UNITED STATES RUSSIA Assembly Donald Times White House Cohen Fox News Dick Cheney Michael Cynthia Nixon University Just Dershowitz Trump Rick Gates LEAKS Paul Southern District Robert Manafort,"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/18/lawmakers-refer-clinton-comey-lynch-mccabe-for-criminal-referrals/:  Specifically, they sent criminal referrals to Sessions for: former FBI Director James Comey, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, as well as FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok and his lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, for separate violations.The criminal referrals, first reported by investigative journalist Sara Carter, were made by Rep.

Castro will remain head of the Communist Party.Cuban state TV showed the two men embracing after the historic vote, as hundreds of National Assembly delegates cheered. Addressing the crowd, Díaz-Canel vowed to fight against any attempts at subversion by capitalist forces, to defend the regime established by his predecessors and to continue ""perfecting"" the socialist model he inherited.""The revolution continues,"" he said.While largely unrecognizable outside Cuba, Díaz-Canel is well-known inside the regime after spending years rising through the ranks of the Communist Party and convincing Castro he could be trusted to carry on the nation's revolutionary ideals.Díaz-Canel, 57, also represents a symbolic change for a regime that has been dominated by the guerrilla fighters who overthrew U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and rode into Havana on New Year's Day 1959.Díaz-Canel used a large portion of his acceptance speech to praise the Castro brothers, focusing on Raúl, who sat in the front row watching and nodding.Díaz-Canel called the younger Castro the ""best disciple of Fidel"" and listed his accomplishments, from military succ esses during the revolution through his time as president after Fidel Castro stepped down due to illness. He even complimented Castro for re-establishing diplomatic relations with the U.S.And he made clear that Raúl Castro would still guide the Cuban government in the years to some. ""I confirm to this assembly that Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,"" Díaz-Canel said.Castro spoke next, providing the first glimpse into his thinking about his own future and that of the Cuban regime. He expects Díaz-Canel to serve two five-year terms as president. And he said he would hand over control of the Communist Party to Díaz-Canel in 2021.""From that point on, I will be just another soldier defending this revolution,"" he said.More: Trump's Cuba rollback leaves U.S. out in the cold for island's futureMore: Cuba's next president: Who is Miguel Díaz-Canel?More: Raúl Castro: 5 things to know about departing Cuba presidentThursday's succession coincided with the 50th anniversary of the failed, U.S.-supported Bay of Pigs invasion, and comes during a downturn in U.S.-Cuba relations.President Trump has ordered most American diplomats out of Cuba following a series of unexplained ""health attacks"" against personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. That move thawed what had been a rare opening between the Cold War foes, a detente brokered between then Presidents Barack Obama and Raúl Castro that led to Americans flooding the island to visit and more business opportunities between the countries.Now, Díaz-Canel is responsible for resolving Cuba's anemic economy and restless population by depending more on countries like Russia, China, Iran and Venezuela.In the months leading up to the ascension of Díaz-Canel, Cuban state media has cautiously introduced him to the outside world.

The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said at a briefing on Thursday: ""In the liberated territories of Eastern Guta, Syrian government forces found containers with chlorine, the most terrible type of chemical weapons, from Germany, as well as smoke bombs from the city, attention, Salisbury, UK ""- I would also like to draw attention to the fact that as early as January 2013 the British newspaper Daily Mail published an article that disclosed information about the consent of the leadership of the White House to the US and its allies' implementation of the chemical attack in Syria and the subsequent imposition of responsibility on the president of this country, Assad, with the aim of strengthening international military operations in that country, ""Zakharova drew attention."" Both Russia and Syria repeatedly stated the availability of data on the preparation of provocations by the militants using chemical weapons, the detection of shops for the production and weapons, and all its species in the liberated territories in East Gut. "" ""All relevant information was sent, sent and will be forwarded to the OPCW,"" the diplomat noted. The US and its Syrian allies were harmed to give radicals and extremists the opportunity to recover their spirit and regain their ranks, she also said. ""Confirmed our assumptions that the true the goal of the Western three was to give the radicals and extremists the opportunity to simply take a breath, rebuild their ranks, prolong the bloodshed on the Syrian land and thereby complicate the process of political settlement, ""she noted. As Zakharova pointed out,"" in the city of the Duma, the irreconcilable militants remaining there, under their fire on Wednesday, April 18, there were members of the United Nations Security Department who were assessing the situation and worked out plans for the OPCW team to travel to the site of the alleged hematoca. """" The identity Apparently without reason, - he continued the spokesman. ""There are apparently fears of militants and extremists about the presence of members and inspectors of the OPCW on the spot."" On April 14, the United States, Britain and France, without the sanction of the UN Security Council, dealt a massive blow to Syria, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Damascus, the headquarters of the Republican Guard, the air defense base, several military airfields, army warehouses. Of the 103 missiles that were fired at the targets, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71. Washington, London and Paris stated that the blows are a response to the supposedly taking place the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Duma. Zakharova, commenting on the statement of the NGO White Helmets that chemical weapons were used in the Duma on April 7, stressed that the images from the Syrian city allegedly affected by the chemical attack are one hundred percent forgery. Many fake materials were distributed to networks, photos, videos from allegedly places of events. Indeed, these places can be confirmed, but in many cases the situation and the circumstances of what happened there are fictitious, ""the diplomat stressed."" This is a hundred percent fake. How do dead children move through the premises, if the main purpose was to confirm the fact of the attack that was carried out? Because for the distribution of fake evidence they needed an emotional color, they had the task to distract from factual inconsistencies, ""Zakharova said.",East Gut Assad Duma Zakharova Nations Security GERMANY Washington NGO Containers OPCW States White House UNITED KINGDOM Eastern Guta Daily Mail FRANCE Council TASS Salisbury Republican Guard United Nations SYRIA RUSSIA,"http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2006900/:  Maria Zakharova: ""In the liberated territories of Eastern Guta, Syrian government troops found containers with chlorine - the most terrible type of chemical weapons - from Germany, as well as smoke bombs production of the city - attention - Salisbury.""


According to her, this fact is even difficult to comment on, it is so ""intimidating and undermining the belief in humanity"" of Western politicians and leaders.

Recall that last week the United States, together with Britain and France, struck at Syrian government facilities. To justify this attack, a far-fetched pretext was used. Damascus was accused of using chemical weapons in the city of Dumas. But later it turned out that the shooting from the ""affected by the chemistry"" Duma was staged.",Eastern Guta FRANCE Duma GERMANY SYRIA Maria Zakharova UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM,"https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Deutschland-nimmt-die-meisten-Asylbewerber-article20394017.html:  60 percent of the people who fled to the EU last year came to Germany. This is announced by the statistics office of the European Union. Only a considerable distance is followed by the other EU member states. Nearly 540,000 asylum seekers received protection in the EU last year, 60 percent of them in Germany alone. Of the 325,400 asylum seekers in Germany, around 154,000 were recognized as refugees, around 120,000 were given provisional protection, according to the EU statistics office Eurostat. Around 50,000 people received a positive asylum decision on humanitarian grounds, Eurostat said. France (40,600), Italy (35,100), Austria (34,000) and Sweden (31,200) are among the clear followers. Very few asylum seekers were accepted in Slovakia (60), Estonia (95) and the Czech Republic (145). Poland and Hungary, which see the refugee policy of the EU very critically, recognized 560 and 1300 persons, respectively. Germany was also the country with the most recognition in relation to the population. Here, per million inhabitants 3945 people were granted protection. At the bottom of the list were the Eastern European states of Slovakia (ten accreditations per million inhabitants), the Czech Republic and Poland (15 accolades each). Hungary, which also opposes an EU-wide redistribution of asylum seekers, came after all 130 recognitions per million inhabitants. The largest group of refugees in the EU came out with about 176,000 again Syria. Around 100,000 people from Afghanistan were taken to safety in the EU and around 64,000 from Iraq. Overall, the number of successful asylum seekers fell by a quarter compared to 2016. In addition, last year, EU Member States welcomed nearly 24,000 people who were relocated directly from crisis areas.

The number of 10,000 refugees that Germany will receive from the camps in Turkey and Libya as part of the EU resettlement program this year and next year does not scare him. ""I'm satisfied, that's absolutely responsible,"" he assures. With the admission, Germany will remain in the corridor of 180,000 to 200,000 refugees this year. EU refugee commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos already knows his Berlin interlocutor from previous appointments, when he was still Bavarian Prime Minister and criticized the Chancellor for the policy of welcome culture at that time. The Brussels Commissioner praises Germany's commitment to the refugee crisis as a benchmark. Germany was one of the first countries to show what it does to talk about solidarity. At EU level, however, the German government has been pushing for a better distribution of this solidarity effort since the summer of 2015. So far not much has happened. 23,000 refugees have been legally distributed to EU countries since July 2015.50,000 more are to follow until autumn 2019. They are expected to be 70 percent Syrian, as Avramopoulos emphasized. The rest are from Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. The selected have the protection status of the Geneva Convention. The chance to relocate from a refugee camp to Europe, should The needy, women and children, in particular, were received by the Commission. Because often only young men get through the tug organizations. Seehofer stressed that the German government has a say in who is selected. According to which criteria this should happen, he kept himself covered. He also pointed out that the aim was to avoid immigration into the social systems. Hungary does not accept anybody. Germany and France each want to receive around 10,000 refugees. Further commitments, according to the EU Commission, include the Netherlands (3000), Belgium (2000), Great Britain (7800) and Sweden (8750). Eastern European countries also want to absorb refugees from the resettlement program on a small scale. Around 200 are to be sheltered in Croatia and just under 150 in Romania. Hungary is numbered ""0"" in the list of 27 EU member states. There is a hard disagreement between Berlin and Brussels on the question of how long the controls at the German external borders can be maintained. ""Schengen is the most important symbol of European integration,"" said Avramopoulos. The border controls could develop into a permanent issue of controversy between the EU Commission and individual countries. Austria wants to control more againSo Austria's Interior Minister Herbert Kickl even announced that they want to step up their control again from the second half of the year. The German Minister of the Interior wants Although from May on he would extend the border controls to Austria for another six months, as he once again emphasized. The Federal Police should refrain from the systematic control of passengers from Greece in the future again. Seehofer also assured Avramopoulos that Germany would work on a solution to make European external borders more secure. At the same time, the Minister of the Interior made it clear that Germany would only waive internal controls if the security of its citizens could be guaranteed at the external borders of the EU. Combat against TugsThe hope of the EU Commission is that the resettlement program could already reduce illegal immigration , EU Commissioner Avramopoulos emphasized that the program is helping to combat the traffickers' trafficking by giving refugees the opportunity to come to Europe legally. EU governments are also negotiating new rules for the distribution of refugees. At present, the failed Dublin Agreement is still in force. After that, the states are responsible for refugees, where they were first registered on European soil. At the height of the refugee crisis, this regulation led to the so-called ""wave-by-wave"". The authorities of the southern and eastern EU countries did not register the migrant refugees so that they could reach Germany or a Scandinavian country.

In front of a huge sum of money. Of public money. Whose purpose is highly controversial? Here is one, drawn from the latest report of the Court of Auditors. A report on ""support for renewable energies"". This digit ? 121 billion euros. It is unavoidable. It represents only the amount of public support to which the State has committed contracts signed before 2017 for the benefit of producers of electricity from wind and photovoltaic (plus a chouïa biomethane) .This 121 billion will be distributed at an annual rate that will go through a peak to 7,179 billion in 2025. They come, according to magistrates of the Court of Auditors whose vocabulary is very polite, ""support mechanisms whose financial consequences have been poorly appreciated."" Another of their formulas actually murders: ""Important, long-lasting and poorly evaluated charges"". It is a chapter title, in large font and bold, just to push the nail.Un flash of lucidityIn a flash of lucidity, the Court calls to ""establish the energy policy on rational arbitrations based on the taking into account. account of the full cost of the different technologies. It is certain that do not completely care about the cost of the various means of energy production, especially for electricity since it is the main part of the report, seems a reasonable idea.Party with this idea for the least respectable, the Court of We have made incredible discoveries in our energy policy, one of the key parameters of which is officially the desire to control greenhouse gas emissions so as not to disturb the climate too much. Among these discoveries, the enormous cost of support to photovoltaic electricity, for a shabby result. Thus the only contracts signed before 2010 will weigh, in total when they come to term, not less than ""38.4 billion euros for public finances"", for ... 0.7% of electricity production (1 ), notes the Court. These contracts will still represent 2 billion a year in 2030 and represent a subsidy of 480 € per MWh. The wind is a little less expensive. But the numbers are, again, cruel. The first contracts of onshore wind will cost ""40.7 billion euros in 20 years"" for ... ""2% of French production,"" says the report. Recently, tenders for floating offshore wind turbines in 2015 could result in a cost of 1.7 billion for less than 100 MW of installed capacity, and 390 gWh per year, or 0.07% of production. national, note the magistrates.Climatologically derisoryThese massive public expenditures, mostly levied on consumers via the electricity bill in the form of the CSPE could have had two reasonable and justified objectives. On the one hand act to control greenhouse gas emissions, as part of the action to reduce the threat of greenhouse gas emissions. climate change. And on the other hand to contribute to feed industrial sectors generating employment on the national territory. The boredom is that the report of the Court confirms on the first point the analysis of a blog post entitled "" Climate policy: French mistake and word fraud "". In summary: the result is a derisory climatological result by mistake on the target of the action, aimed at electricity instead of targeting the most emitting sectors of greenhouse gases, such as heating or road transport. However, as the French electricity system, whose base consists of nuclear power and hydro-electricity, is already decarbonated to nearly 95%, it can not be an effective target for climate action. We can read on page 22 of the report: ""Thus, given its low carbon energy profile, if France had wanted to make its renewable energy policy a lever to fight against global warming, it should have focused its priorities efforts on the thermal RE sector, which mainly replace fossil fuels emitting CO2. As a result, the role devoted to electric renewable energies in the French strategy meets another objective of energy policy, which consists in substituting renewable energies for nuclear energy. ""However, the Court does it in a bizarre way. . In order to put its reasoning, the report begins by recalling the basic the problem linking electricity production and greenhouse gas emissions with a graphic she thinks eloquent: Already, the journalist told the judges that he is tired of having to remind that a graph of this type must be built with an ordinate axis starting at 0 and not at another value that will distort the ratio between the quantities compared. Otherwise, we make illusion. The text of the Court's graph states that each German's emissions are about twice that of a Frenchman (more than 9 tons against about 4.8), while the image of the same graph induces the idea that they are about ten times larger relative. Such a gap between text and image is neither reasonable nor educational. Then, it's nice to compare these total emissions, but since the report essentially only talks about electricity, it would be better to provide one on the subject. Here is one: But the court also offers excellent graphics to illustrate its reasoning. Here is one that compares the public expenditure on electric and thermal REEs in 2015 and 2016: In summary? Acting for thermal REs that directly reduce massive uses of gas and oil for heating would be really effective for climate goals ... and we spend almost nothing of public effort. On the other hand, the support for electric REs has practically no climatic effects but takes up most of the public financial effort. The key to the problem? While it is presented under the heading of climate action, the only practical result of support for electric REs is to contribute to a reduction in the share of nuclear power in electricity production. Why not (everyone can keep their opinion on this), but it is not certain that if we had said to the French ""you will spend at least 121 billion euros just to reduce by a few percent the share of nuclear in the electrical system, they would have jumped with joy. Industrial sectors At least, does this public bonanza translate into mass jobs? At the level of the amounts committed? The Court produces two graphs on this subject. The first clearly indicates that a part of this money went abroad to finance the imports of solar panels, with a record of almost 3 billion euros of deficit in 2010, left in China for the most part (2 ): As far as jobs are concerned, the graph below shows a transient peak of activity at the time of installation of the solar panels, but it shows above all that by concentrating public expenditure on thermal RE (wood, geothermal, networks of heat, heat pumps), we could have made a double blow: many less GHG emissions and more sustainable jobs. Will this report of the Court of Auditors trigger a salutary discussion, within the framework of public debate on the multiannual programming of the energy organized by the National Commission for Public Debate at the request of the government? It would be useful. Especially if the various actors in this debate finally agree to drop propaganda and advertising to designate things with words whose purpose will be clarity and sincerity and not generalized deception (read here a post on this topic). CostsOn the topics of debate requiring this operation truth, the price on the various means of electricity production is needed. Under pressure from public opinion, the nuclear industry has long made this work of transparency, internally, or subject to external audits such as the various reports of the Court of Auditors on the full cost of nuclear energy, including waste and dismantling, but also public research. However, the RE sector is totally exempt from such an approach. As shown here by two economists from the Toulouse School of Economics, this cost must include expenses related to the compensation of the intermittency of solar and wind energy. I would add that it is also necessary to count the network expenses related to their introduction, so Germany plans to spend 40 billion euros for its high voltage network to adapt to the installation of renewable energy. However, taking these costs into account - the amount of which is specific to each electrical system and the share of these energies - radically changes the situation. It shows that calculations based on The price of installing and operating a means of production (whatever it may be) in isolation from the system is far removed from reality. (1) Evil minds will not fail to bring these nearly 40 billion almost identical sum announced by EDF to put its nuclear reactors in condition to produce for 20 years more ... 75% of the electricity we need. (2) The bad spirits will not fail to bring this commercial deficit closer to the positive balance of our balance exports / imports of electricity, due to the nuclear, which allows us to buy ... Chinese solar panels.Report this as inappropriate contentYour e-mail address will not be published.

In total, 103 military cruise missiles were calculated, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71 of them. The main targets, the Russian military department notes, are military facilities in Syria, in particular, several air bases. The cause for the attack was the statements of the so-called White Helmets and a number of non-governmental organizations about the alleged use by Damascus of chemical weapons - bombs with chlorine - in the city of Duma. According to Russian specialists who visited the site, no traces of poisonous substances and injured from them were found.

According to her, this fact is even difficult to comment on, it is so ""intimidating and undermining the belief in humanity"" of Western politicians and leaders.

Recall that last week the United States, together with Britain and France, struck at Syrian government facilities. To justify this attack, a far-fetched pretext was used. Damascus was accused of using chemical weapons in the city of Dumas. But later it turned out that the shooting from the ""affected by the chemistry"" Duma was staged.",Eastern Guta FRANCE Duma GERMANY SYRIA Maria Zakharova UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM,"https://russian.rt.com/world/article/504868-ssha-rossiya-udar-rakety:  The Congressional Research Center published a report on possible problems associated with the concept of a rapid global strike. In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments. In a number of countries, Washington's actions have caused outrage. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the US missile strikes aggression against a sovereign state. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the strikes on the SAR illegal. He criticized the actions of Washington and China - another permanent member of the UN Security Council, where the situation in Syria was discussed.",New York East Gut James Mattis Wall Street Great Lavrov Bush POLAND Viktor Murakhovsky George Vladimir Putin USSR IRAN Washington SAR Security Council CHINA Ministry Defense Alexei Leonkov UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Emelianov North Trump SYRIA Street Journal Expert Pentagon,"http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2006766/:  Russia and the Western countries reacted differently to the report of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the outcome of the examination of the toxic agent that was used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia in Salisbury. Actually, the report confirms that it was a nerve agent of the class, codenamed ""Rookie,"" but neither the producer's country nor the laboratory where this chemical agent could create the OPCW experts could establish.


Alexander Shulgin, Russia's permanent representative to the OPCW: ""We first asked a key question to the head of the ministry: is it really true, according to the British, that based on the results of the OPCW expertise, can we judge the country of the toxic chemical used? And we got an absolutely clear unambiguous answer: no, this is not possible. It is not possible to establish, according to the results of the analysis, where the thread stretches, to which country. ""

Nevertheless, at a meeting of the organization in The Hague, the representative of Great Britain insisted that once the conclusions of experts coincided with the conclusions of the British special services, it means that the investigation decided correctly: ""Novice"" came to Salisbury from Russia, nowhere else. But Russian experts believe that not everything is so unambiguous. Three years ago, a patent for the ""Newbie"" was registered in the United States, where the substance was produced. Documents on this have now been submitted to the OPCW Executive Board.

The debate about the ""Novice"" continued in New York. Britain called the Council Safely to report on the findings of the OPCW expert commission, but instead of the facts, the country's permanent representative operated on ""competent opinion"".

In response, Russia's permanent representative Vasily Nebenzia asked to clarify whether allegations of Russia's involvement in the Salisbury incident - with no evidence at all - are pressure on the British investigation.

On March 4, former Colonel GRU Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliya were uncovered in Salisbury. According to the British authorities, they were poisoned by the nerve agent ""Novice"", developed during the USSR. London accused Moscow of poisoning the Violins and on the basis of these charges expelled a group of Russian diplomats from the country. After this, the example of Britain was followed by the authorities of several other countries, a total of more than 100 Russian diplomats were expelled from Europe and the United States. The authorities of Russia categorically deny their involvement in what happened to the Violins. According to Zakharova, the fact of the discovery in Syria of chlorine from Germany and smoke Checkers from Salisbury are difficult even to comment on, it is so ""frightening and undermining the belief in the humanity of individual states."" ""Of course, we are not talking about whole states, but about those politicians and leaders who give such orders and make such decisions,"" she said. Zakharova.

Thomas Jnr, 51, who is the American actress' half-brother, claims the 36-year-old has forgotten her roots by refusing to invite close relatives as she prepare to tie the knot with Prince Harry. Mr Markle, from Oregon, accused his sibling of turning her back on the family and said she is 'falsely' trying to portray herself as the new Princess Diana. He told the Daily Mirror: 'She's clearly forgotten her roots. It's torn my entire family apart. Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people's person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family.'She is giving the greatest ­performance of her life. She is acting phoney. I've read that Meg wants to be like Diana. Diana was worshipped by everyone in the world. She was loved for the right reasons.'That's what Meg wants, but I don't think that's going to happen. She's not genuine like Diana.' Mr Markle has not seen his sister since 2011 when the pair – and Meghan's film producer ex Trevor Engleson, 41 – attended the Los Angeles funeral of their grandmother, Doris. But speaking exclusively to DailyMailTV last month, the 51-year-old said: 'I haven't got an invite yet but I do expect to get one. It would be really nice [to get an invitation] and it would mean a lot.'I do expect one and I'm looking forward to going. I don't see why not. It is what it is. I am family, estranged or not.'Of the letter mailed to Ke nsington Palace, Markle Jr added: 'I sent a letter. Just basically [saying] I'm really happy for you, congratulations, you're amazing, you're going to do well and congratulations.'No, I didn't hear back but I'm sure she's busy. She's got a lot on her plate right now – she's in a whirlwind. She's becoming a princess.'It's probably really hard for her to think about anything else except for her wedding and everything like that.'Meghan, 36, will marry Prince Harry, 33, at the 14th century St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on May 19.Of the 36-year-old's own family, only her mother Doria Ragland, 61, of Los Angeles, California, and her reclusive father Thomas Markle Sr, 73, are likely to be part of the 600-strong congregation.Meghan is also understood to be close to her niece Ashleigh Hale, 31, and her graphic designer half-uncle Joffrey Ragland, 34, who may also travel to England for the nuptials.Half-sister Samantha Grant, 53, is not thought to have received an invitation while Markle Jr's ex-wife Tracey Dooley and son Tyler, 26, have already admitted to being left out. Yesterday Ms Grant questioned Harry's humanitarian work and accused him of being a hypocrite by 'allowing Meg to ignore the Markles'.Her tweet came as Meghan was embarking on her first major event on behalf of the Royal Family today when she joined Prince Harry for a Commonwealth reception in London. She wrote: 'It's time to 'man up' @HRHHenryWindsor. 'Shout outs' about humanitarianism, don't work when you are allowing Meg to ignore the Markles. It is s (sic) contradiction. 'Someone must point out that the ""Emperor is not wearing any clothes"".'However the account she was directing the message at is not actually the Prince, but a fan account pretending to be him. According to Markle Jr, his uncle Frederick, 76, a self-styled bishop who runs his own tiny church in Sanford, Florida, is likely to go to Windsor, whether or not he receives an invitation.Although Meghan's brother is still hoping to make the guest list, he admitted that his and fiancée Darlene Blount's run-ins with the law could have left the former Suits star 'embarrassed'.Markle Jr was arrested in January 2017 for drunkenly holding a gun to Blount's head while his fiancée, 37, was collared on New Year's Eve for allegedly assaulting him while in a booze-fueled rage.Blount was released without charge two days after her arrest while the case against Markle Jr was dropped before it went to court.He told DailyMailTV: 'I'm a private citizen - just so happens, my sister's marrying Prince Harry so all I do now is look round the corner to see if someone with a camera is following me around.'I'm human and mistakes happen and drinking happens and fights happen and it is what it is. If she's embarrassed about that, then I'm sorry.'But that's why I did reach out and say, hey, let's do something about this because you should want to get along anyway.'      According to Markle Jr, he contacted the Palace for help with dealing with his new-found fame late last year, only to be told that he is on his own.He said: 'I don't know if it [the email] ever got to her, I don't know if she ignored it, but she didn't reply back, I guess.'It's not that it hurts, it goes with her schedule - she's extremely busy all day, all week. Her agenda is planned out weeks in advance, I'm sure of it.'But it would be nice of her to drop a line and say hello once in a while.'Markle Jr, whose parents are Meghan's father Thomas and his first wife Roslyn, 72, says he hopes the upcoming wedding will lead to a family reunion – and an end to the feuds that have rocked the Markle clan.Illinois-born Markle Jr is currently estranged from his son Tyler, as well as sister Samantha and half-sister Meghan.His mother Roslyn, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, does not speak to Samantha, who has also fallen out with her daughter Noel, 19, her ex-husband Scott Rasmussen, 57, and Meghan herself.Like Samantha, of Ocala, Florida, Markle Jr says he is planning a book or a movie about his famous half-sister and contributed to Diana biographer Andrew Morton's upcoming book, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Nonetheless, the 51-year-old says he is sure he will see Meghan again, whether on May 19 or not, and bristled at suggestions that he is a 'distant' relation.'Gosh, I'm not that distant,' he insisted. 'But like I said before, when she took off to start her career [in Toronto], everybody becomes distant – even my father got it.'He probably got a little upset becaus e he wasn't needed so much anymore.'Markle Jr added: 'She could never forget me. Her and I always got along really good, we spent a lot of time together before she left [Los Angeles in 2011].'She knows who I am and I'm not distant, I may be distant distance wise, as in 4,000 miles, but that's it.'And if he doesn't travel to London for Meghan and Harry's wedding, Markle Jr says he won't feel too bad about being left off the guest list because he's busy planning his own nuptials.'I won't be heartbroken, it'll be OK,' he told DailyMailTV. 'I won't be upset. I've got my own wedding to plan. We haven't set a date yet but it's coming up pretty soon.'",Markles Albuquerque Thomas Jnr Samantha New Florida UNITED STATES SURINAME MEXICO Sanford Illinois Scott Ocala DailyMailTV Hollywood Los Angeles Palace Andrew Morton Suits Roslyn Doria Ragland California Meg Diana Jr Harry Ashleigh Hale Darlene Blount Toronto UNITED KINGDOM Joffrey Tyler Tracey Dooley Shout England Royal Family HRHHenryWindsor Trevor Engleson Meghan Markle,"http://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/tv/high-fines-herbes-le-csa-s-autosaisit-19-04-2018-7673331.php:  The new show of the chain Viceland, ""High & herbs"", devoted to cannabis, really put the CSA in firecracker.

In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments. In a number of countries, Washington's actions have caused outrage. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the US missile strikes aggression against a sovereign state. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the strikes on the SAR illegal. He criticized the actions of Washington and China - another permanent member of the UN Security Council, where the situation in Syria was discussed.",New York East Gut James Mattis Wall Street Great Lavrov Bush POLAND Viktor Murakhovsky George Vladimir Putin USSR IRAN Washington SAR Security Council CHINA Ministry Defense Alexei Leonkov UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Emelianov North Trump SYRIA Street Journal Expert Pentagon,"http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2006766/:  Russia and the Western countries reacted differently to the report of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the outcome of the examination of the toxic agent that was used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia in Salisbury. Actually, the report confirms that it was a nerve agent of the class, codenamed ""Rookie,"" but neither the producer's country nor the laboratory where this chemical agent could create the OPCW experts could establish.


Alexander Shulgin, Russia's permanent representative to the OPCW: ""We first asked a key question to the head of the ministry: is it really true, according to the British, that based on the results of the OPCW expertise, can we judge the country of the toxic chemical used? And we got an absolutely clear unambiguous answer: no, this is not possible. It is not possible to establish, according to the results of the analysis, where the thread stretches, to which country. ""

Nevertheless, at a meeting of the organization in The Hague, the representative of Great Britain insisted that once the conclusions of experts coincided with the conclusions of the British special services, it means that the investigation decided correctly: ""Novice"" came to Salisbury from Russia, nowhere else. But Russian experts believe that not everything is so unambiguous. Three years ago, a patent for the ""Newbie"" was registered in the United States, where the substance was produced. Documents on this have now been submitted to the OPCW Executive Board.

The debate about the ""Novice"" continued in New York. Britain called the Council Safely to report on the findings of the OPCW expert commission, but instead of the facts, the country's permanent representative operated on ""competent opinion"".

In response, Russia's permanent representative Vasily Nebenzia asked to clarify whether allegations of Russia's involvement in the Salisbury incident - with no evidence at all - are pressure on the British investigation.

Buzzfeed published the dossier in January 2017.Cohen's travel has been of particular interest, as the Steele dossier alleges Cohen met with Russian officials in a country in the European Union — which was later reported to have been the Czech Republic. Cohen has denied the meeting ever took place and offered his passport as proof he has never been to Prague.A recent report from McClatchy said that Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, has found evidence that Cohen did travel to Prague.Cohen filed the Buzzfeed lawsuit in January in New York, claiming that the ""entirely and totally false"" allegations in the dossier had damaged his reputation.In a court document filed Wednesday, Cohen's lawyer, David Schwartz, served notice that the lawsuit against BuzzFeed and four of its employees had been dropped.Cohen also dropped his lawsuit against Fusion GPS, the research firm that contracted Steele to assemble the dossier, according to various news reports.Matt Mittenthal, director of communications for BuzzFeed News, said in a statement that the lawsuit never had merit.""The lawsuits against BuzzFeed over the Steele dossier have never been about the merits of our decision to publish it,"" Mittenthal wrote.In a statement, Fusion GPS said, ""We welcome, though are not surprised, that Michael Cohen opted to withdraw this meritless complaint rather than face a discovery process that would have forced him to defend his reputation and address the allegations of the Steele dossier under penalty of perjury. With his decision, it appears that Mr. Cohen can now focus on his many other legal travails.""Cohen did not immediately return a request for comment.BuzzFeed also faces a lawsuit from owners of a Russian bank over the dossier.BuzzFeed published the dossier in January 2017 and noted at the time that the allegations in the document had not bee substantiated. Still, the publication of the dossier stirred controversy and helped ignite speculation on Trump's connections to Russia.The dossier has been a hot topic among conservative pundits who have claimed that it is illegitimate and fueled Mueller's investigation.Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, wrote a New York Times op-ed a year after publishing the dossier in which he defended his decision to make the document public.""Without the dossier, Americans would have found it difficult to understand the actions of their elected representatives and government officials,"" he wrote.Cohen is currently dealing with other legal issues.

They went on to this success for a long time, taking the second place five times, ""said Roman Elizarov, chairman of the jury of ICPC's regional semi-final in Northern Eurasia, tutor of ITMO University. The final stage of the competition was held on April 19, 2018 in Beijing, the capital of the PRC. 140 teams from 51 countries, of which 11 represented Russia, had to solve 11 tasks in five hours. According to the terms of the competition, only one computer is available to each team without access to the Internet, so, in addition to knowing the algorithms, the ability to think logically and find non-standard approaches to solve problems, the participants had to demonstrate their skills in working in a team in a time-limited environment. The students of the Moscow State University succeeded in solving nine problems successfully. The last of them they passed two minutes before the end of the competition, and this was enough for a confident victory. In addition to the title of the champion at the Olympics, gold, silver and bronze medals are played out. In the past, they were awarded the best 12 teams of the tournament, but this year 13 teams decided on seven adach, so the judges decided to award one additional award: it went to the Ural Federal University (UrFU). Other Russian teams also entered the list of winners. Second place and gold medals for the correct decision eight tasks were won by students of MIPT. Representatives of St. Petersburg ITMO - the winner of the tournament in 2017 and the current record holder for the number of victories in it - took the ""bronze"", having coped with seven tasks. Also, among the 13 best teams were representatives of the Beijing University (China), the University of Tokyo (Japan) , Seoul National University (South Korea), University of New South Wales (Australia), Tsinghua University (China), Shanghai University of Transportation, University of Central Florida (USA), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA) and Vilnius The tournament began in 2018 with 42 records, bringing together a record number of participants - nearly 50,000 students from nearly 3.1 thousand universities from 111 countries competed at all stages of the Olympiad. Russian programmers participate in the ACM ICPC since 1993 and have been consistently winning over the past seven years. Since 2000, Russians have made 13 steps to the top step of the podium. In 2017, the ITMO team won the victory. In 2016 our compatriots representing SPSU again distinguished themselves. In 2015, ITMO students turned out to be stronger than their competitors, for the first time among all the teams in the world having solved all the tasks. The 2014 tournament also ended in the triumph of the Russian school programming: the team of St. Petersburg State University solved seven tasks in five hours and won the championship cup.

In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments. In a number of countries, Washington's actions have caused outrage. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the US missile strikes aggression against a sovereign state.

""It's something that can lie in the Senate chamber. Facts may lead to passage or not.""Tillis said he plans to continue lobbying leadership on the bill, even after McConnell explicitly rejected the legislation.""This is not necessary, there's no indication that Mueller is going to be fired,"" McConnell said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday. He added, ""We'll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.""But Tillis and other supporters of the bill say they aren't backing down. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said Wednesday that the goal isn't necessarily to pass a measure with the hope of forcing Trump to decide between signing the bill or issuing a veto. The real goal, he said, is to send the president a message.""If the goal — and I think it should be — is to convince the president not to take this action,"" Flake told reporters, ""I think the message needs to be that we take this very seriously.""There are plenty of Republicans who say they agree the issue should be taken seriously, but they want to lobby Trump quietly — not through an aggressive public measure like voting on this bill.Supporters of the legislation say that's just wishful thinking. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Tuesday that Republicans who hope they can persuade Trump not to fire Mueller through such discussions aren't facing reality.""If he's not listening to his own lawyers, I don't think he's going to listen to a bunch of U.S. senators,"" Blumenthal said.Trump has crossed Republicans on a number of issues, like the recent tariffs on China. Many in Congress have grown wary of a string of White House firings — like that of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — that came without any warning. Blumenthal said Trump could do the same to Mueller.Another group of Republicans, including McConnell and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, simply believe Trump won't fire Mueller.""It's hard for me to just hypothetically think in this direction because I just don't think it's going to happen,"" Hatch said on Tuesday. ""It would be a mistake.""There are also political reasons for Republicans to want to avoid a public display of support for Mueller. Forcing a vote could also create an impossible choice for Republicans running for re-election against strong Democratic challengers.Either they vote against the president and commit what would be considered a cardinal sin by many in Trump's fervent base, or th ey vote against protecting Mueller, which could anger moderates worried Republicans won't stand up to Trump.Either way, Democrats like Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois want Republicans on the record.""It isn't a question of whether Trump might one day veto it,"" Durbin said Tuesday. ""It's whether they believe in the integrity of the special counsel or they believe anybody, including the president, should be above criminal investigation.""For now, a majority of Republicans say they agree that the special counsel should be allowed to finish his investigation. And they say they trust that Trump won't get in his way.Speaking at a news conference with Japan's prime minister Wednesday in Florida, Trump provided little clarity about the fate of Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has overseen the Justice Department investigation since last year.Trump repeated his charge that the Russia matter is a ""hoax,"" but he stopped short of saying he would fire Mueller or Rosenstein.""They've been saying I'm going to get rid of them for the last three months, four months, five months, and they're still here,"" Trump said.The president also reiterated his view that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russians involved in the election interference. He also said that the White House has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation and ""we want to get it over with, done with, put it behind us.""",Ky Democratic Rosenstein Hatch Utah Justice Department Dick Durbin CHINA Republican Thom Forcing White House Durbin Illinois Fox News SENEGAL Supporters Orrin Hatch Robert Mueller Mitch McConnell Carolina Republican North Carolina Conn Congress Leader Mitch Trump Senate Majority Richard Blumenthal Majority Leader JAPAN Flake Thom Tillis RUSSIA,"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/19/cuba-president-raul-castro-miguel-diaz-canel/530101002/:  After six decades of rule by Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl Castro, Cuba turned a new page Thursday when it named Communist Party loyalist Miguel Díaz-Canel president.Cuba's National Assembly concluded a two-day session, where Raúl Castro stepped down after 10 years in the presidency and endorsed the election of Díaz-Canel, his handpicked successor. Castro will remain head of the Communist Party.Cuban state TV showed the two men embracing after the historic vote, as hundreds of National Assembly delegates cheered.

He even complimented Castro for re-establishing diplomatic relations with the U.S.And he made clear that Raúl Castro would still guide the Cuban government in the years to some. ""I confirm to this assembly that Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,"" Díaz-Canel said.Castro spoke next, providing the first glimpse into his thinking about his own future and that of the Cuban regime. He expects Díaz-Canel to serve two five-year terms as president. And he said he would hand over control of the Communist Party to Díaz-Canel in 2021.""From that point on, I will be just another soldier defending this revolution,"" he said.More: Trump's Cuba rollback leaves U.S. out in the cold for island's futureMore: Cuba's next president: Who is Miguel Díaz-Canel?More: Raúl Castro: 5 things to know about departing Cuba presidentThursday's succession coincided with the 50th anniversary of the failed, U.S.-supported Bay of Pigs invasion, and comes during a downturn in U.S.-Cuba relations.President Trump has ordered most American diplomats out of Cuba following a series of unexplained ""health attacks"" against personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Havana.

He blamed the news media for spreading a narrative that he said portrays him as being afraid to stand up to Russia.“There’s been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump,” the president said, citing increased U.S. military spending among his examples. “With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough, because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there’s been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.Trump mentioned the joint U.S., French and British military operation last weekend that struck several sites in Syria to punish the Russian-backed government of President Bashar Assad for an apparent chemical attack that killed civilians. Trump said the strike was “absolute precision.”Trump had largely avoided criticizing Russia, leaving the harsh rhetoric and sanctions announcements to others in the administration. But he began to criticize Russia on Twitter after the apparent chemical attack this month that spawned images of Syrian adults gasping for air and being hosed off.Still, Trump said he would prefer good relations with Russia and other nation s.“If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.

The official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said at a briefing on Thursday: ""In the liberated territories of Eastern Guta, Syrian government forces found containers with chlorine, the most terrible type of chemical weapons, from Germany, as well as smoke bombs from the city, attention, Salisbury, UK ""- I would also like to draw attention to the fact that as early as January 2013 the British newspaper Daily Mail published an article that disclosed information about the consent of the leadership of the White House to the US and its allies' implementation of the chemical attack in Syria and the subsequent imposition of responsibility on the president of this country, Assad, with the aim of strengthening international military operations in that country, ""Zakharova drew attention."" Both Russia and Syria repeatedly stated the availability of data on the preparation of provocations by the militants using chemical weapons, the detection of shops for the production and weapons, and all its species in the liberated territories in East Gut. "" ""All relevant information was sent, sent and will be forwarded to the OPCW,"" the diplomat noted. The US and its Syrian allies were harmed to give radicals and extremists the opportunity to recover their spirit and regain their ranks, she also said. ""Confirmed our assumptions that the true the goal of the Western three was to give the radicals and extremists the opportunity to simply take a breath, rebuild their ranks, prolong the bloodshed on the Syrian land and thereby complicate the process of political settlement, ""she noted. As Zakharova pointed out,"" in the city of the Duma, the irreconcilable militants remaining there, under their fire on Wednesday, April 18, there were members of the United Nations Security Department who were assessing the situation and worked out plans for the OPCW team to travel to the site of the alleged hematoca. """" The identity Apparently without reason, - he continued the spokesman. ""There are apparently fears of militants and extremists about the presence of members and inspectors of the OPCW on the spot."" On April 14, the United States, Britain and France, without the sanction of the UN Security Council, dealt a massive blow to Syria, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Damascus, the headquarters of the Republican Guard, the air defense base, several military airfields, army warehouses. Of the 103 missiles that were fired at the targets, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71. Washington, London and Paris stated that the blows are a response to the supposedly taking place the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Duma. Zakharova, commenting on the statement of the NGO White Helmets that chemical weapons were used in the Duma on April 7, stressed that the images from the Syrian city allegedly affected by the chemical attack are one hundred percent forgery. Many fake materials were distributed to networks, photos, videos from allegedly places of events. Indeed, these places can be confirmed, but in many cases the situation and the circumstances of what happened there are fictitious, ""the diplomat stressed."" This is a hundred percent fake. How do dead children move through the premises, if the main purpose was to confirm the fact of the attack that was carried out? Because for the distribution of fake evidence they needed an emotional color, they had the task to distract from factual inconsistencies, ""Zakharova said.",East Gut Assad Duma Zakharova Nations Security GERMANY Washington NGO Containers OPCW States White House UNITED KINGDOM Eastern Guta Daily Mail FRANCE Council TASS Salisbury Republican Guard United Nations SYRIA RUSSIA,"https://russian.rt.com/world/article/504868-ssha-rossiya-udar-rakety:  The Congressional Research Center published a report on possible problems associated with the concept of a rapid global strike. In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments. In a number of countries, Washington's actions have caused outrage. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the US missile strikes aggression against a sovereign state. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the strikes on the SAR illegal.

Moreover, the Americans do not sell Tomahawks for export: ""Such weapons usually have a self-liquidation system in case of an abnormal situation, in which there is no defeat of the target,"" said Sergei Denisentsev, an expert at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies. Perhaps the missiles remained intact, because this system for some reason did not work or it was not at all. Denisentsev considers it useful to obtain samples of such weapons.

It should be recalled that Viktor Murakhovsky, member of the expert council of the board of the Military-Industrial Commission, also noted that specialists in Russia, thanks to Syria's two cruise missiles used in the attack of the United States, Western developments and improve its missile defense system.

On March 4, former Colonel GRU Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliya were uncovered in Salisbury. According to the British authorities, they were poisoned by the nerve agent ""Novice"", developed during the USSR. London accused Moscow of poisoning the Violins and on the basis of these charges expelled a group of Russian diplomats from the country. After this, the example of Britain was followed by the authorities of several other countries, a total of more than 100 Russian diplomats were expelled from Europe and the United States. The authorities of Russia categorically deny their involvement in what happened to the Violins. According to Zakharova, the fact of the discovery in Syria of chlorine from Germany and smoke Checkers from Salisbury are difficult even to comment on, it is so ""frightening and undermining the belief in the humanity of individual states."" ""Of course, we are not talking about whole states, but about those politicians and leaders who give such orders and make such decisions,"" she said. Zakharova.

He blamed the news media for spreading a narrative that he said portrays him as being afraid to stand up to Russia.“There’s been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump,” the president said, citing increased U.S. military spending among his examples. “With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough, because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there’s been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.Trump mentioned the joint U.S., French and British military operation last weekend that struck several sites in Syria to punish the Russian-backed government of President Bashar Assad for an apparent chemical attack that killed civilians. Trump said the strike was “absolute precision.”Trump had largely avoided criticizing Russia, leaving the harsh rhetoric and sanctions announcements to others in the administration. But he began to criticize Russia on Twitter after the apparent chemical attack this month that spawned images of Syrian adults gasping for air and being hosed off.Still, Trump said he would prefer good relations with Russia and other nation s.“If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.

Trump.The settlement agreement, reached on Wednesday, ends a lawsuit brought by the model, Karen McDougal, and protects the president from being drawn into a legal case involving efforts to buy the silence of women who had stories to tell about him during the 2016 campaign.He still faces another lawsuit from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford is suing to get out of a deal that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, arranged in 2016 for her silence about an alleged affair. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied both women’s stories.In August 2016, A.M.I., which owns The National Enquirer, acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story about Mr. Trump — which it never ran — in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her current career as a fitness specialist.Under the terms of Wednesday’s settlement, A.M.I. has the right to up to $75,000 of any future profits from her story about the alleged affair. According to her lawyer, Peter K. Stris, Ms. McDougal can keep the $150,000 payment, and the publisher will retain the rights to photographs of her that it already has.In a statement, A.M.I. called the settlement an “amicable resolution” and said that under the new agreement it would devote an upcoming magazine cover and fe ature article to Ms. McDougal, and would run several of her fitness columns in its publications.“It’s a total win,” Mr. Stris said in an interview. “We got everything we were fighting for — she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes A.M.I. nothing more.”In a separate interview, Ms. McDougal expressed elation about the end of her “wild ride,” and said she currently had no plans to sell the rights to her story to a new buyer. “It’s one step at a time for me,” she said. “Today, I’m doing my victory dance.”Her lawsuit said that A.M.I., whose chairman, David J. Pecker, is a friend of President Trump’s, misled her into signing the contract. It also claimed that Mr. Cohen had inappropriately intervened in the deal. A.M.I. had denied misleading her.The deal and the extent of Mr. Cohen’s role in it are the subjects of a wide-ranging federal corruption investigation that is, in part, looking into his efforts to protect Mr. Trump’s presidential prospects in 2016.A.M.I. indicated earlier this month that it would fight Ms. McDougal, asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her lawsuit.But that was roughly a week before federal investigators obtained email communications, audio recordings and other documentation from Mr. Cohen during their raid of his office, home and hotel room. Those materials included information about A.M.I. and the McDougal suit, people involved in the case said.The suit also claimed that Mr. Cohen had been secretly involved in the talks b etween A.M.I. and Ms. McDougal’s lawyer at the time, Keith M. Davidson — who emailed Mr. Cohen at the end of the negotiations. A spokesman for Mr. Davidson has said the lawyer “fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal.”A.M.I. also spoke with Mr. Cohen about Ms. McDougal, though it says it did so only as part of its reporting process.Mr. Stris said that before reaching the settlement, he was prepared to answer A.M.I.’s motion to dismiss Ms. McDougal’s case with a request for a limited version of pretrial discovery. The move, compelling both sides to share emails and other records, could have provided information that would not be available through the material the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen. An A.M.I. lawyer, Cameron Stracher, said that he doubted the request would have succeeded, and that avoiding discovery was not a motivating factor in the settlement.The agreement precludes any of that from happening, at least in Ms. McDougal’s civil case against A.M.I., though Mr. Stris said he expected federal investigators to eventually secure everything they needed to fully vet the process behind the deal. “I have tremendous confidence in the men and women of the Southern District of New York,” he said, referring to the federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Stris said he did not rule out taking legal action if more came to light about potentially inappropriate contact between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson during the course of negotiating her deal. The settlement does not bar Ms. McDougal from claims against either of the men in the future. For now, Ms. McDougal said, “I need to relax and get my life back and de-stress.”The initial deal prohibited Ms. McDougal from speaking about her alleged affair, but A.M.I. amended the contract after the election to allow her to answer “legitimate press inquiries,” in response to her complaints that the agreement was overly restrictive. In recent months, she has spoken to The New Yorker and Anderson Cooper of CNN.Separate from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, A.M.I. is facing a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that its $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal was an illegal campaign expenditure.

Schneiderman of New York is moving to change New York state law so that he and other local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to President Trump who have been pardoned, according to a letter Mr. Schneiderman sent to the governor and state lawmakers on Wednesday.The move, if approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Legislature, would serve notice that the legal troubles of the president and his aides may continue without the efforts of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Under the plan, Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, seeks to exempt New York’s double jeopardy law from cases involving presidential pardons, according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The current law and the concept of double jeopardy in general mean that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice.Right now, New York state law prevents people from being prosecuted more than once for crimes related to the same act, even if the original prosecution was in federal court. There are already a number of exceptions to the law, and the letter says that Mr. Schneiderman is proposing to add a new one that could be used if federal pardons are issued.Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman have a contentious past. Mr. Schneiderman led a three-year investigation of Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. For his part, the president has dubbed Mr. Schneiderman “the nation’s worst AG.” He has also called him a “lightweight” and a “total loser,” and even tweeted that he wore eyeliner.While Mr. Schneiderman’s jurisdiction does not encompass many of the areas being investigated by Mr. Mueller, a president has no authority to commute sentences or pardon offenses at the state level. That leaves convictions obtained by the state attorney general’s office or any other local prosecutor outside the president’s ability to intervene. The proposal would be structured so that it would not affect people who sought clemency after long jail sentences, an aide to Mr. Schneiderman said.If the proposed law is passed, anyone indicted on state charges after being convicted in federal court and then pardoned would likely challenge the state law in court. But Mr. Schneiderman wrote in the letter that he and his advisers were confident the legislation would withstand any constitutional scrutiny.Even though New York is a reliably blue state, Mr. Schneiderman’s proposal is hardly a foregone conclusion, given the narrow political divide in the State Senate.“We are disturbed by reports that the president is considering pardons of individuals who may have committed serious federal financial, tax, and other crimes — acts that may also violate New York law,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement provided by his office.“We must ensure that if the president, or any president, issues such pardons, we can use the full force of New York’s l aws to bring such individuals to justice.”The White House declined to comment.The president has openly discussed his pardon powers, and reportedly even asked his aides whether he could pardon himself, though one of his lawyers denied it.“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon,” he tweeted last year, “why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.”Just last week, when lawyers for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who is himself the subject of a criminal investigation apparently unrelated to Mr. Mueller’s probe, were in court clashing with prosecutors over a search warrant, Mr. Trump pardoned former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr.Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and a frequent Fox News commentator, said after reading Mr. Schneiderman’s letter that his proposal raises constitutional questions that cannot be answered without examining the legislation.“The first is the specificity of the statute — of the exception — focusing on a limited number of people,” he said, noting that legislatures cannot make laws that apply to specific individuals. But he added that it was possible that such legislation, if properly drawn, would be constitutional.Mr. Schneiderman’s move could set off a battle in the State Senate, where Republicans have narrowly controlled the chamber through alliances with Democrats. Earlier this month, though, most Democrats in the chamber ended a long- running feud, which has left a degree of doubt over long-term control of the body. An April 24 special election in Westchester County could determine who will lead the chamber.The measure would likely be supported by Mr. Cuomo, who is tacking left in the face of a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist. The state’s Assembly has long been a bulwark of liberal ideals.State Senator Todd D. Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said in a statement that he would introduce a bill to “close the glaring loophole” highlighted by Mr. Schneiderman’s letter. Similar legislation will be introduced in the Assembly.Mr. Schneiderman’s move is likely to inflame allies of Mr. Trump, who see Mr. Schneiderman as an opportunist bent on making political hay, and whom they see as unlikely to treat Mr. Trump fairly.This is hardly the first time Mr. Schneiderman has challenged Mr. Trump.A month before the 2016 election, his office ordered Mr. Trump’s foundation to stop raising money in New York amid scrutiny over Mr. Trump’s claims about charitable giving. The $25 million settlement over Trump University came shortly after the election. Mr. Schneiderman called the settlement “a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”The attorney general’s office has also investigated Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, who was indicted on federal charges last year, though he deferred his inquiry amid t he federal investigation.The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution has a double jeopardy clause that says “nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” But that applies to multiple prosecutions of the same federal offense.The states are almost evenly split between those that have additional double jeopardy protections at the state level and those that do not. And Mr. Schneiderman has successfully backed changes to the double jeopardy law before. In 2011, the state closed what was known as the “Helmsley loophole,” named for the headline-grabbing hotelier Leona Helmsley, allowing it to prosecute tax cheats who had already been prosecuted federally.“New York’s statutory protections could result in the unintended and unjust consequence of insulating someone pardoned for serious federal crimes from subsequent prosecution for state crimes,” Mr. Schneiderman writes in his letter, “even if that person was never tried or convicted in federal court, and never served a single day in federal prison.”Whether Mr. Schneiderman’s office would even seek to become involved in a criminal prosecution of Mr. Trump or his aides remains to be seen. But his move only adds to Mr. Trump’s legal problems.Several of Mr. Trump’s former aides have pleaded guilty in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, including Rick Gates, a former campaign adviser, and Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser. Earlier this month, the Southern District of New York, an office of the Justice Department outside of Mr. Mueller’s, revealed it was investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Trump has made his feelings about these investigations plain in a recent tweet that said, simply, “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”",New York Fifth Amendment Lewis Libby TOTAL Leona Libby Jr Flynn Mueller Alan Helmsley Harvard Law Law School UNITED STATES RUSSIA Assembly Donald Times White House Cohen Fox News Dick Cheney Michael Cynthia Nixon University Just Dershowitz Trump Rick Gates LEAKS Paul Southern District Robert Manafort
UNITED KINGDOM Michael Gove,"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43817287:  Plastic straws and cotton buds could be banned in England as part of the government's bid to cut plastic waste.Ministers pointed to one estimate that 8.5bn plastic straws were thrown away in the UK every year.The prime minister said plastic waste was ""one of the greatest environmental challenges facing the world"".And Theresa May will urge leaders at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which began earlier, to follow the UK's lead in tackling the problem.The Queen has formally opened the summit at an event at Buckingham Palace attended by prime ministers and presidents from the 53 states that make up the organisation.Mrs May claimed the UK was a ""world leader"" on tackling plastic waste, highlighting the charges that have been introduced for plastic bags, the ban on microbeads and the announcement in March of a consultation on introducing a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in England.""Alongside our domestic action, this week we are rallying Commonwealth countries to join us in the fight against marine plastics,"" she said.""The Commonwealth is a unique organisation, with a huge diversity of wildlife, environments and coastlines.""Together we can effect real change so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it.""Analysis: By BBC science editor David ShukmanThe environment secretary Michael Gove describes plastic waste as a worldwide emergency, which naturally raises questions about the speed of the governme nt's response.The headlines talk of a ban on plastic straws - but the announcement is about a consultation to do that. A similar exercise is under way about a deposit scheme for plastic drinks bottles, and MPs were not impressed on Wednesday when they learned that the system itself will not come into effect until 2020.When ministers talk of the UK leading the world on this hot topic it's worth casting an eye over the actions of other countries. Dozens have actually banned plastic bags - Britain has a system of retailers having to charge for them.And since last year Kenya has adopted the most draconian measures of all: there are fines if you use a plastic bag and if business people are caught making or importing them, they actually face up to four years in jail.Amid many claims about fighting a war on plastic, the Kenyans are leading the charge.It comes as 60 UK music festivals, including Bestival in Dorset and Boomtown in Hampshire, have said they will ban plastic straws at their events this summer.Bestival's co-founder Rob Da Bank said they were ""leading the global charge against unnecessary plastic"", as the group of festivals also pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2021.Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who trailed the idea of banning plastic straws in February, will launch the consultation later this year.""We're going to consult on what the best way is in order to get rid of straws, get rid of stirrers and also get rid of plastic stemmed cotton buds that we u se so many of,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""It's a worldwide emergency - that's why we're choosing to act. It's also why we're working with other Commonwealth countries.""He said a consultation was necessary, particularly in relation to straws, because there were some disabled people who need to use plastic straws.Mr Gove said a number of retailers, bars and restaurants were already cutting plastic use, with the plastic bag ban set to be extended from major retailers to all retailers.Scotland's Environment Minister Roseanna Cunningham announced earlier this year a plan to ban plastic straws, following a similar move aimed at banning the sale and manufacture of plastic-stemmed cotton buds.And a spokesman for the Welsh Government indicated it would also consider a ban: ""We would welcome collaboration from the UK government on any action on banning straws. We will work with Defra to look at how this can be done effectively in Wales.""Greenpeace UK and Friends of the Earth have welcomed the announcement as a ""step forward"" but both also warned more action would be needed.Greenpeace's Louise Edge said other non-recyclable ""problem plastics"" should also be banned at the earliest opportunity and retailers must take responsibility to phase out single-use plastics in their own products.Friends of the Earth's Julian Kirby said the ""only long-term solution is a complete phase-out of all but the most essential plastics"".The news was welcomed by the Green Party, but co-leader Jon athan Bartley said the government ""must see these plans through to action, and bring forward the utterly un-ambitious target of eliminating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042"".Earlier this week, Mrs May announced the new Clean Oceans Alliance - an agreement between the UK, Vanuatu, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Ghana, which pledged to ban microbeads cosmetics and cut plastic bag use by 2021.To fund it, she also assigned £61.4m for global research and to improve waste management in developing countries.Do you have any questions about the government's plans to cut plastic waste?

He was commenting on the decision to scrap thousands of landing cards that was taken in 2010, which he insisted would have been referred to ministers.But the environment secretary, Michael Gove, who was education secretary for some of the time and would have been involved in aspects of the policy, dismissed the claim.“I’ve never heard anyone make that comparison before Lord Kerslake. It’s not for me to criticise a distinguished former public servant like Lord Kerslake but I respectfully disagree.”He added that after the Brexit vote, people felt able to be compassionate because countries that could control their borders were able to be more generous.“I think we can see in the national conversation that we have had about the Windrush generation that people are so glad that this country has had a tradition of welcoming people from abroad.”Gove’s remarks came as the prime minister prepared to address the opening session of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) on Thursday afternoon. At the gathering, the Queen will meet the heads of g overnment of the Caribbean countries, some of whose former citizens’ lives have been blighted by the chaos over immigration documentation.Kerslake came to Whitehall from a highly successful career in local government, and rose rapidly to the top. But he later fell out with the Cameron administration. For two years from 2012, he was joint head of the civil service, sharing the running of Whitehall with Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, before departing abruptly after two years.The job was then reunited under Heywood, in what was widely regarded as a political move.Permanent secretaries like Kerslake meet every week to discuss and coordinate government business, and he would have been very familiar with problems in other departments.Former Liberal Democrat ministers in the coalition and some special advisers have been speaking out about their fight to try to soften the policy.Sarah Teather, who was minister for children and families, revealed in 2013 that an internal working group on immigration was initially named the “hostile environment working group, with its name only changed following Lib Dem objections.Teather, who is now the director of the Jesuit Refugee Service, said: “Theresa May was determined to transform things. She was proud of wanting to generate a really hostile environment.“The Home Office has a culture of enforcement and disbelief which runs deep into the walls, but it is politically led. It’s a culture from the top, and it has been a bit rich for th e home secretary, Amber Rudd, to blame civil servants. When you’ve had a Conservative home secretary that long, you cannot moan when civil servants deliver those policies.”A Lib Dem special adviser at the time, Polly Mackenzie, tweeted on Tuesday night that the “hostile environment” mission started with an inter-ministerial group set up on “migrant access to benefits and public services”.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, warned that the impact of the way people who had settled in the UK years ago could have their rights challenged could jeopardise negotiations over future rights of EU citizens.He said the concern “is that if your approach to immigration is to create a hostile environment … that might flow into any post-Brexit relations with the EU and that would be a really bad way forward and it is time for the prime minister to be clear about that,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Gove went out of his way to stress Britain’s open approach to migration and to praise Amber Rudd’s handling of the affair. He said her apology had been “graceful” and “a model”, and insisted she had “taken a grip”.Mackenzie claims that May’s mission was to make it systematically difficult to get by without papers, even though the Home Office had no firm evidence of the scale of the alleged abuse.Work checks, school registration, hospital and GP appointments, bank accounts and credit were all among the everyday activities where proof of status could be required.“I saw endless pape rs claiming the system was ‘unsustainable in the current economic climate’ but no evidence to back it up,” she tweeted.A former head of the UK border force said on Thursday that something had gone “badly wrong” at the Home Office with the loss of experience and knowledge of immigration as a result of departmental reorganisations.“Corporate memory and expertise has been lost with the abolition of the immigration service and subsequently the abolition of the UK Border Agency now as well,” said Tony Smith, a veteran official in immigration enforcement who was the interim director general of the UK Border Force between 2012 and 2013.“A lot of people were let go who had that experience and we have tried to codify all that experience on the basis of documents that people may or may not have, and we don’t have an identity management system.”This loss, Smith told the Today programme, was at the heart of problems with the hostile environment strategy.“In summary, you need an identity management strategy if you are going to have a hostile environment. You can’t have one without the other,” he said.He said: “We did not back the hostile environment with an identify management strategy. We thought about identity cards, didn’t we? We did start issuing biometric residence permits to newcomers in 2008 but we didn’t offer those to people who were already here, like a green card system in the US.”Smith mourned changes to the traditional culture among officials working in immigration, who follo wed a career path that allowed them to accumulate expertise at home and abroad in various roles.“I was called out regularly to police stations to talk to people who had been arrested for something or other and the police couldn’t tell whether they were allowed to be here or not. We were allowed to take pragmatic decisions based on what they told us – whether or not an enforcement decision could be taken.”Smith described the controversy over the destruction of landing cards recording the dates of arrival in Britain of members of the so-called Windrush generation as a red herring, saying that there would have been other ways to carry out necessary checks.He added: “All this blame culture about whether or not these landing cards would have made a difference is a complete red herring to me. It’s about being able to talk to people sensibly with a degree of knowledge or expertise and come to a sensible conclusion.”",Radio Mackenzie Cameron Michael Gove Lord Kerslake Whitehall Refugee Service GERMANY Home Brexit UNITED KINGDOM Jeremy Heywood Sir Jeremy Jesuit Refugee Nazi Queen Smith Keir Starmer Sarah Chogm Lib Dem Caribbean BBC Newsnight,"http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2018/04/19/le-royaume-uni-veut-interdire-les-pailles-et-cotons-tiges-en-plastique_5287674_3214.html:  ""We are going to ban these plastic items,"" said UK Environment Minister Michael Gove, who was questioned about the BBC, saying it was ""a global emergency"" that is particularly threatening to marine life.

In total, 103 military cruise missiles were calculated, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71 of them. The main targets, the Russian military department notes, are military facilities in Syria, in particular, several air bases. The cause for the attack was the statements of the so-called White Helmets and a number of non-governmental organizations about the alleged use by Damascus of chemical weapons - bombs with chlorine - in the city of Duma. According to Russian specialists who visited the site, no traces of poisonous substances and injured from them were found. Moscow called statements about the Khimatka and the accompanying stenuyuschie video clips staged and provoked.

Containers with chlorine from Germany and smoke bombs from Salisbury are found in East Gut.

Both Russia and Syria repeatedly stated the availability of data on the preparation of provocations by the militants using chemical weapons, the detection of shops for the production and weapons, and all its species in the liberated territories in East Gut. "" ""All relevant information was sent, sent and will be forwarded to the OPCW,"" the diplomat noted. The US and its Syrian allies were harmed to give radicals and extremists the opportunity to recover their spirit and regain their ranks, she also said. ""Confirmed our assumptions that the true the goal of the Western three was to give the radicals and extremists the opportunity to simply take a breath, rebuild their ranks, prolong the bloodshed on the Syrian land and thereby complicate the process of political settlement, ""she noted. As Zakharova pointed out,"" in the city of the Duma, the irreconcilable militants remaining there, under their fire on Wednesday, April 18, there were members of the United Nations Security Department who were assessing the situation and worked out plans for the OPCW team to travel to the site of the alleged hematoca.

Of the 103 missiles that were fired at the targets, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71. Washington, London and Paris stated that the blows are a response to the supposedly taking place the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Duma. Zakharova, commenting on the statement of the NGO White Helmets that chemical weapons were used in the Duma on April 7, stressed that the images from the Syrian city allegedly affected by the chemical attack are one hundred percent forgery.

In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments.

He blamed the news media for spreading a narrative that he said portrays him as being afraid to stand up to Russia.“There’s been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump,” the president said, citing increased U.S. military spending among his examples. “With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough, because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there’s been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.Trump mentioned the joint U.S., French and British military operation last weekend that struck several sites in Syria to punish the Russian-backed government of President Bashar Assad for an apparent chemical attack that killed civilians. Trump said the strike was “absolute precision.”Trump had largely avoided criticizing Russia, leaving the harsh rhetoric and sanctions announcements to others in the administration. But he began to criticize Russia on Twitter after the apparent chemical attack this month that spawned images of Syrian adults gasping for air and being hosed off.Still, Trump said he would prefer good relations with Russia and other nation s.“If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Just remember that,” Trump said as he ended a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The leaders had spent the past two days discussing such issues as North Korea and trade — and playing golf.“If we got along with other nations, that’s good, not bad,” Trump said.A day earlier, an internal White House quarrel over the timing of new Russia sanctions played out in public after Trump’s new economic adviser suggested U.N.

Both Russia and Syria repeatedly stated the availability of data on the preparation of provocations by the militants using chemical weapons, the detection of shops for the production and weapons, and all its species in the liberated territories in East Gut. "" ""All relevant information was sent, sent and will be forwarded to the OPCW,"" the diplomat noted.

""There are apparently fears of militants and extremists about the presence of members and inspectors of the OPCW on the spot."" On April 14, the United States, Britain and France, without the sanction of the UN Security Council, dealt a massive blow to Syria, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Damascus, the headquarters of the Republican Guard, the air defense base, several military airfields, army warehouses. Of the 103 missiles that were fired at the targets, Syrian air defense forces shot down 71. Washington, London and Paris stated that the blows are a response to the supposedly taking place the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Duma. Zakharova, commenting on the statement of the NGO White Helmets that chemical weapons were used in the Duma on April 7, stressed that the images from the Syrian city allegedly affected by the chemical attack are one hundred percent forgery. Many fake materials were distributed to networks, photos, videos from allegedly places of events. Indeed, these places can be confirmed, but in many cases the situation and the circumstances of what happened there are fictitious, ""the diplomat stressed."" This is a hundred percent fake. How do dead children move through the premises, if the main purpose was to confirm the fact of the attack that was carried out?

According to her, this fact is even difficult to comment on, it is so ""intimidating and undermining the belief in humanity"" of Western politicians and leaders.

Recall that last week the United States, together with Britain and France, struck at Syrian government facilities. To justify this attack, a far-fetched pretext was used.

the 70th anniversary of the State of Israel raises a state-bearing roar, which in his psychology recalls the famous whistling in the forest. The media and political staging of the anniversary will be a celebration of international understanding. The main text building blocks of the speeches and editorials: the historical responsibility of the Germans for Israel, the solidarity to Israel's right to exist, the never-ending commemoration of the Holocaust, ""Never again!"" And In this sense, the determined fight against any kind of anti-Semitism - all grounded by the unbreakable German-Israeli friendship. This is the tone Angela Merkel coined ten years ago in her great speech in the Knesset, when she said: ""The historical responsibility of Germany is part of Reason of state of my country. That is, the security of Israel is never negotiable for me as German Chancellor. And if that is so, then in the hour of probation, that must not remain empty words. ""For the birthday of the State of Israel she is particularly loud, because everyone knows that the reality is currently very different. In fact, it has not been so bad for the reputation of Israel in Germany in a long time. And a new anti-Semitism seizes the country without disturbing large parts of the population. The main problem is not so much what happens, but that what happens has no consequences. In pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel demonstrations, i n Germany again and again Israeli flags. The consequence: a debate about a new law, which should forbid this behavior (which would not be necessary, because existing laws for sanctioning are long enough). Meanwhile, however, the flags continue to be burned. In schools, more and more children are bullied, physically attacked or threatened with death as ""Jews"". The consequence: Volker Kauder proposes a nationwide registration for anti-Semitic incidents at educational institutions. Meanwhile, more and more parents take their Jewish children from school. It was not until Tuesday, at the Helmholtzplatz in Berlin, that a young man hit a kippah-bearing Israeli student with a belt and - as a Facebook video documented - repeatedly called ""Yahudi"" (Arabic for Jew). The FDP District Chairman of Delmenhorst, Tamer Sert , in a Facebook post, speaks of the ""terror state of Israel"". The consequence: the post office is still available. Neither Facebook nor the Network Enforcement Act, nor any notable politician takes offense. An international lobby organization is calling for a boycott of Israeli products, and in the country where nine-quarters of a century ago, ""Do not buy from Jews"" was smeared on the walls of the shops no restlessness. The consequence: a few editorials and quiet politician distancing. A Frankfurt judge judges that the decision of Kuwait Airways, a Jew because of his was not lawful on a flight from Frankfurt. Another behavior was the airline unreasonable. The consequence: only hesitant were known politicians concerned with the topic. The airline continues to fly from Germany, the next flight will go to Kuwait this Friday. One can assume that Jews will be sorted out again and again, on German soil. And finally, the rapper Kollegah and Farid Bang, who fuse with anti-Semitic texts and cartoons: ""My body defined as by Auschwitzinsassen"" and ""make again a Holocaust 'Come on with the Molotov,' one of them rapped, the other spread a cartoon in which the 'Stürmer' style shows men with hooked noses and Kippa as rulers in all areas of society.The consequence of the lyrics: Die Medien, die they criticize, are criticized, an ethics council deals with the nomination, can not take offense after a thorough examination, and the rappers get the echo prize. One may only imagine for a moment what outrage in this country - rightly so - It would have flared if a musician with such openly anti-Muslim texts had received this prize. But when it comes to Jews, textsemiotic explanations about the provocative language of gangsta rap dominate and need to be understood. The feelings of Holocaust survivors? You can not take care of everything. It is good that Campi No has clearly objected at the award ceremony, it is noble and exemplary that Marius Müller-Westernhagen and some other musicians have returned all echoes ever received. Unfortunately, a mass movement has not yet emerged. Kollegah and colleagues are now holding their stomach with laughter. For the 70th anniversary of Israel, Germany is making a name for itself as a world champion of lip service. Solidarity with Israel and the fight against anti-Semitism take place on paper. Why? Israel is a democracy and a constitutional state, and as such, it is alone in the wider field of the explosive region of the Middle East. The government of Israel may be criticized for very good reasons, some Israeli army maneuvers may get out of hand, Israel's settlement policy may be considered awkward or outrageous - in the end, the country is deeply rooted in Western values, democracy is at least that intact as ours, and the rule of law applies in a most exemplary way, not sparing even the highest authorities. There are currently three trials against the incumbent Prime Minister, a predecessor of his, Ehud Olmert, landed in 2016 after a trial in prison, and became a president found guilty in a sexual harassment and rape case. All this is in sharp contrast to many other countries in the Middle East, where, for example, harassed women are stoned when they over It would be in our interest, if not out of historical responsibility, at least out of selfishness, to stand more clearly on the side of this country in defense of a common system of values ​​and common security interests. But this requires leadership, especially spiritual leadership. And then the fronts blur these days. And the coordinates are shaken. When children are gassed in Syria, Germany is out in pacifism. And almost as often as criticizing dictator Assad, criticism is being heard on German streets and in the offices for Trump, Macron, and May, for bombarding the dictator's military facilities and airports. The new mainstream is the intersection of autocratic and fundamental pacifists. AfD and left harmonize dazzling. And woe, if in this situation one from the middle of society points out that in the phases of uncontrolled migration a new form of anti - Semitism has also been established by Islamist immigrants, an unfortunate alliance of old national and new Muslim anti - Semites The 70th anniversary of Israel is thus in Germany for Menetekel for a society that threatens to lose its inner compass. The lesson from the genocide of the Nazis and the Second World War has unfortunately been misunderstood. Never again intervene militarily, keep out better. Instead: never again Tota Litarism, never again racism, never again tolerance for genocide. In memory we are giants. In action and helping dwarfs. For many years I am almost always asked somewhere in my travels to Israel: ""If it gets really rough, if Israel is attacked, its existence is in question, then we can rely on Germany, you will Send weapons and soldiers? ""I used to say yes in a firm voice. In the last few years, my yes has been a bit hesitant. Today I would say: Better not rely on us. Masal Tow Israel!

The anti-Semitism commissioner of the Federal Government, Felix Klein, called for a realistic depiction of Muslim anti-Semitism in crime statistics.

UNITED STATES Los Angeles,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5632923/Meghan-Markles-brother-says-shes-phoney-tearing-family-apart.html:  Meghan Markle's brother has revealed that her royal wedding snub has 'torn the family apart'. Thomas Jnr, 51, who is the American actress' half-brother, claims the 36-year-old has forgotten her roots by refusing to invite close relatives as she prepare to tie the knot with Prince Harry. Mr Markle, from Oregon, accused his sibling of turning her back on the family and said she is 'falsely' trying to portray herself as the new Princess Diana. He told the Daily Mirror: 'She's clearly forgotten her roots. It's torn my entire family apart. Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people's person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family.'She is giving the greatest ­performance of her life. She is acting phoney. I've read that Meg wants to be like Diana. Diana was worshipped by everyone in the world. She was loved for the right reasons.'That's what Meg wants, but I don't think that's going to happen. She's not genuine like Diana.' Mr Markle has not seen his sister since 2011 when the pair – and Meghan's film producer ex Trevor Engleson, 41 – attended the Los Angeles funeral of their grandmother, Doris. But speaking exclusively to DailyMailTV last month, the 51-year-old said: 'I haven't got an invite yet but I do expect to get one. It would be really nice [to get an invitation] and it would mean a lot.'I do expect one and I'm looking forward to going. I don't see why not. It is what it is. I am family, estranged or not.'Of the letter mailed to Ke nsington Palace, Markle Jr added: 'I sent a letter. Just basically [saying] I'm really happy for you, congratulations, you're amazing, you're going to do well and congratulations.'No, I didn't hear back but I'm sure she's busy. She's got a lot on her plate right now – she's in a whirlwind. She's becoming a princess.'It's probably really hard for her to think about anything else except for her wedding and everything like that.'Meghan, 36, will marry Prince Harry, 33, at the 14th century St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on May 19.Of the 36-year-old's own family, only her mother Doria Ragland, 61, of Los Angeles, California, and her reclusive father Thomas Markle Sr, 73, are likely to be part of the 600-strong congregation.Meghan is also understood to be close to her niece Ashleigh Hale, 31, and her graphic designer half-uncle Joffrey Ragland, 34, who may also travel to England for the nuptials.Half-sister Samantha Grant, 53, is not thought to have received an invitation while Markle Jr's ex-wife Tracey Dooley and son Tyler, 26, have already admitted to being left out. Yesterday Ms Grant questioned Harry's humanitarian work and accused him of being a hypocrite by 'allowing Meg to ignore the Markles'.Her tweet came as Meghan was embarking on her first major event on behalf of the Royal Family today when she joined Prince Harry for a Commonwealth reception in London. She wrote: 'It's time to 'man up' @HRHHenryWindsor. 'Shout outs' about humanitarianism, don't work when you are allowing Meg to ignore the Markles. It is s (sic) contradiction. 'Someone must point out that the ""Emperor is not wearing any clothes"".'However the account she was directing the message at is not actually the Prince, but a fan account pretending to be him. According to Markle Jr, his uncle Frederick, 76, a self-styled bishop who runs his own tiny church in Sanford, Florida, is likely to go to Windsor, whether or not he receives an invitation.Although Meghan's brother is still hoping to make the guest list, he admitted that his and fiancée Darlene Blount's run-ins with the law could have left the former Suits star 'embarrassed'.Markle Jr was arrested in January 2017 for drunkenly holding a gun to Blount's head while his fiancée, 37, was collared on New Year's Eve for allegedly assaulting him while in a booze-fueled rage.Blount was released without charge two days after her arrest while the case against Markle Jr was dropped before it went to court.He told DailyMailTV: 'I'm a private citizen - just so happens, my sister's marrying Prince Harry so all I do now is look round the corner to see if someone with a camera is following me around.'I'm human and mistakes happen and drinking happens and fights happen and it is what it is. If she's embarrassed about that, then I'm sorry.'But that's why I did reach out and say, hey, let's do something about this because you should want to get along anyway.'      According to Markle Jr, he contacted the Palace for help with dealing with his new-found fame late last year, only to be told that he is on his own.He said: 'I don't know if it [the email] ever got to her, I don't know if she ignored it, but she didn't reply back, I guess.'It's not that it hurts, it goes with her schedule - she's extremely busy all day, all week. Her agenda is planned out weeks in advance, I'm sure of it.'But it would be nice of her to drop a line and say hello once in a while.'Markle Jr, whose parents are Meghan's father Thomas and his first wife Roslyn, 72, says he hopes the upcoming wedding will lead to a family reunion – and an end to the feuds that have rocked the Markle clan.Illinois-born Markle Jr is currently estranged from his son Tyler, as well as sister Samantha and half-sister Meghan.His mother Roslyn, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, does not speak to Samantha, who has also fallen out with her daughter Noel, 19, her ex-husband Scott Rasmussen, 57, and Meghan herself.Like Samantha, of Ocala, Florida, Markle Jr says he is planning a book or a movie about his famous half-sister and contributed to Diana biographer Andrew Morton's upcoming book, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess.Nonetheless, the 51-year-old says he is sure he will see Meghan again, whether on May 19 or not, and bristled at suggestions that he is a 'distant' relation.'Gosh, I'm not that distant,' he insisted. 'But like I said before, when she took off to start her career [in Toronto], everybody becomes distant – even my father got it.'He probably got a little upset becaus e he wasn't needed so much anymore.'Markle Jr added: 'She could never forget me.

Trump.The settlement agreement, reached on Wednesday, ends a lawsuit brought by the model, Karen McDougal, and protects the president from being drawn into a legal case involving efforts to buy the silence of women who had stories to tell about him during the 2016 campaign.He still faces another lawsuit from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford is suing to get out of a deal that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, arranged in 2016 for her silence about an alleged affair. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied both women’s stories.In August 2016, A.M.I., which owns The National Enquirer, acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story about Mr. Trump — which it never ran — in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her current career as a fitness specialist.Under the terms of Wednesday’s settlement, A.M.I. has the right to up to $75,000 of any future profits from her story about the alleged affair. According to her lawyer, Peter K. Stris, Ms. McDougal can keep the $150,000 payment, and the publisher will retain the rights to photographs of her that it already has.In a statement, A.M.I. called the settlement an “amicable resolution” and said that under the new agreement it would devote an upcoming magazine cover and fe ature article to Ms. McDougal, and would run several of her fitness columns in its publications.“It’s a total win,” Mr. Stris said in an interview. “We got everything we were fighting for — she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes A.M.I. nothing more.”In a separate interview, Ms. McDougal expressed elation about the end of her “wild ride,” and said she currently had no plans to sell the rights to her story to a new buyer. “It’s one step at a time for me,” she said. “Today, I’m doing my victory dance.”Her lawsuit said that A.M.I., whose chairman, David J. Pecker, is a friend of President Trump’s, misled her into signing the contract. It also claimed that Mr. Cohen had inappropriately intervened in the deal. A.M.I. had denied misleading her.The deal and the extent of Mr. Cohen’s role in it are the subjects of a wide-ranging federal corruption investigation that is, in part, looking into his efforts to protect Mr. Trump’s presidential prospects in 2016.A.M.I. indicated earlier this month that it would fight Ms. McDougal, asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her lawsuit.But that was roughly a week before federal investigators obtained email communications, audio recordings and other documentation from Mr. Cohen during their raid of his office, home and hotel room. Those materials included information about A.M.I. and the McDougal suit, people involved in the case said.The suit also claimed that Mr. Cohen had been secretly involved in the talks b etween A.M.I. and Ms. McDougal’s lawyer at the time, Keith M. Davidson — who emailed Mr. Cohen at the end of the negotiations. A spokesman for Mr. Davidson has said the lawyer “fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal.”A.M.I. also spoke with Mr. Cohen about Ms. McDougal, though it says it did so only as part of its reporting process.Mr. Stris said that before reaching the settlement, he was prepared to answer A.M.I.’s motion to dismiss Ms. McDougal’s case with a request for a limited version of pretrial discovery. The move, compelling both sides to share emails and other records, could have provided information that would not be available through the material the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen. An A.M.I. lawyer, Cameron Stracher, said that he doubted the request would have succeeded, and that avoiding discovery was not a motivating factor in the settlement.The agreement precludes any of that from happening, at least in Ms. McDougal’s civil case against A.M.I., though Mr. Stris said he expected federal investigators to eventually secure everything they needed to fully vet the process behind the deal. “I have tremendous confidence in the men and women of the Southern District of New York,” he said, referring to the federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Stris said he did not rule out taking legal action if more came to light about potentially inappropriate contact between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson during the course of negotiating her deal. The settlement does not bar Ms. McDougal from claims against either of the men in the future. For now, Ms. McDougal said, “I need to relax and get my life back and de-stress.”The initial deal prohibited Ms. McDougal from speaking about her alleged affair, but A.M.I. amended the contract after the election to allow her to answer “legitimate press inquiries,” in response to her complaints that the agreement was overly restrictive. In recent months, she has spoken to The New Yorker and Anderson Cooper of CNN.Separate from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, A.M.I. is facing a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that its $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal was an illegal campaign expenditure. The publisher has denied this and says it acts solely as a news organization with a First Amendment right to run stories — or not run them — as it chooses.",New York Stephanie Clifford Superior Court Anderson Cooper Media Davidson Pecker Stormy Daniels UNITED STATES Keith Donald Cohen District New Michael Angeles Superior Trump David Karen McDougal Cameron Stracher Yorker Los Angeles Southern District Ms,"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/19/most-californians-back-more-deportations-nearly-half-support-travel-ban-survey-finds.html:  An overwhelming majority of Californians want to deport more illegal immigrants, and nearly half support President Trump's travel ban aimed at reducing terrorism, according to a new survey from the University of California at Berkeley's Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society.But in reporting the findings of the statewide December 2017 survey, the Haas Institute on Wednesday appeared to put a liberal spin on some of the results.For example, the headline of its news release reads, ""Majority of Californians oppose border wall, support racial inclusion.""But the actual data say that in California, ""66 percent reject the idea that the U.S.-Mexico border wall is an important immigration policy priority"" -- not that they oppose the wall entirely.And results also demonstrate that only 54 percent -- or slightly more than half -- of Californians ""have positive views of Muslims,"" and only 51 percent ""oppose banning people from majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.""Meanwhile, ""59 percent find it important to increase deportations of those here without documentation.""

Kansas Donald Trump UNITED STATES,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/18/kansas-terror-plot-kill-muslims-conviction:  Three members of a Kansas militia with a hatred of Muslim immigrants have been found guilty of plotting to blow up a mosque and apartment complex that housed Somali refugees in order to “wake people up”.A federal jury in Wichita convicted Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen on charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights.Wright was also convicted of lying to the FBI. The men, who pleaded not guilty, face up to life in prison when they are sentenced on 27 June.Their plot developed against a backdrop of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric as Donald Trump’s presidential campaign intensified ahead of the November 2016 election.According to prosecutors, the group decided to detonate explosive-filled vehicles at corners of an apartment complex with many Somali residents.After a tip-off from a paid informant – another militia member, whose covert recordings were played in court – the FBI began a months-long domestic terrorism investigation of militia groups known as the Kansas Security Force and the Crusaders.In phone conversations and meetings in the city of Liberal, authorities said, the accused referred to Muslims as “cockroaches” and denigrated Somali women.They schemed to destroy the complex in Garden City, a place with 27,000 inhabitants about 210 miles west of Wichita that was once held up as a beacon for ethnic diversity in the rural midwest because of an influx of immigrants working at a meat-packing plant.“Their ul timate goal was to wake people up and to slaughter every man, woman and child in the building,” the assistant US attorney Anthony Mattivi said in his closing argument in federal court in Wichita on Tuesday.Authorities said the bombing was to have been timed for the day after the election because the conspirators feared that an attack before the vote would boost turnout for Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.“We cannot let Hillary back into the White House,” Stein allegedly said in text messages to an undercover agent. “If she was to be elected, it would be very soon after the election, ‘game on.’”In an apparent echo of Trump’s pre-election claim that the vote was being “rigged” against him, a lawyer for Stein said in 2017 that his client believed that Barack Obama would have declared the outcome invalid and introduced martial law if the Republican candidate won, and so was preparing to “defend” himself for a period of social unrest.In January this year the judge denied a request from the defendants’ attorneys to increase the number of Trump voters in the jury pool.Defense lawyers argued that the men were merely expressing views, not developing concrete plans, that they were propelled by unfair government tactics and that “we all have the right to hate”.According to the criminal complaint, the men “routinely expressed a hatred for Muslims, individuals of Somali descent, and immigrants. Prosecutors said they chose the target because of their hatred of these groups, th eir perception that these groups represent a threat to American society, a desire to inspire other militia groups, and a desire to “wake people up”.Stein, armed with a pistol and assault rifle, wearing a ballistic vest and holding a night vision scope, conducted surveillance on a mall popular with Somali shoppers, on a mosque and on cars occupied by Muslims.He is said to have told the informant that he had the same explosive components as those used by Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people in 1995.Described by law enforcement as a leader of the group, Stein discussed various possible attacks, including shooting Muslim refugees in a revenge attack for the 2016 Orlando nightclub massacre, blowing up Somali people in their apartments using rocket-propelled grenades, and burning down mosques and churches that have helped refugees.He allegedly said: “The only fucking way this country’s ever going to get turned around is it will be a bloodbath” and “The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim”.Wright had dropped pins on Google Maps of locations of possible targets. In October 2016, after Allen’s girlfriend contacted local police to make an assault claim, agents executed a search warrant at Allen’s house and found bomb-making materials, guns and “close to a metric ton of ammunition”.Hate crime incidents rose across the US in 2016, according to FBI statistics, with Muslims frequently targeted.Mursal Naleye, the president of Garden City’s African community ce nter, said the verdict would bring relief to Garden City’s 500-strong Somali refugee community.“I’m so happy. Everybody in this community will feel safer,” he said.“If they found them not guilty, people would have started leaving to get away from the city. But now everyone is saying: ‘OK, we feel safe.’”Naleye said the community had been on edge since the foiled attack was announced by US prosecutors shortly before the 2016 election. “As soon as it happened, when we found out there were people trying to attack our community, everyone felt different. It opened up a lot of nerves.”Two high-profile, fatal hate-related crimes have taken place in Kansas in recent years. Last month a white man pleaded guilty to the fatal shooting of an Indian immigrant in a bar in Kansas City in February 2017. Witnesses said that Adam Purinton yelled “get out of my country!” before firing at two men who worked as engineers.In 2015 a white supremacist who said he wanted to murder Jews and that “diversity is a code word for white genocide” was convicted of murdering three people, including a 14-year-old boy, outside Jewish centers.Moussa Elbayoumy, of the Kansas branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, warned that America’s current political atmosphere was making open expressions of hate seem more acceptable.“We have seen the negative perceptions of Islam and expressions of that have definitely increased over the last year,” he said. “We feel that the political atmosphere did not incite t hese feelings as much as made it easier for them to go out in the open. It became acceptable to express those feelings where in the past people had them but did not actually act on them or take them out in public.”Speaking after the sentence, he said: “We hope that this decision will be a forewarning for any people that have any hate ideas in their heads or want to act on those feelings in a violent way, that they will be held accountable.“As much as we see a small minority of people being vocal against immigrants and refugees, we are finding a larger number of people with a louder voice expressing support and welcoming immigrants and refugees, so there’s a silver lining.”Ifra Ahmed, another prominent member of Garden City’s Somali community, said that the town had rallied together throughout the weeks of proceedings.“Sometimes people say things that are hurtful. But that doesn’t mean it’s how you should see things. I think we’re able to look past that because the reality is that there’s a lot of good people in this town. And people have been good to us.”“I love this place,” he said. “This town is my home.”",Donald Trump Gavin Wright Islamic Relations Democratic Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma Kansas Garden City SOUTH AFRICA Wichita FBI Indian UNITED STATES Republican Patrick Stein Google Maps Mursal Naleye Anthony Mattivi White House Islam Hillary Clinton Curtis Allen Moussa Elbayoumy Barack Obama Ifra Ahmed SOMALIA Jewish Purinton,"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-contempt-of-court_us_5ad7b383e4b029ebe020a301:  A Kansas federal judge ruled Wednesday that Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) was in contempt of court for failing to follow her order to register voters who had signed up to vote at the DMV but had failed to present proof of citizenship. U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson said Kobach had failed to comply with a 2016 preliminary injunction that blocked a Kansas law requiring people to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote. The decision affected roughly 18,000 people whose registrations were being held up, and Robinson told Kobach to make sure those voters were fully registered. Kobach assured her that he would and that he would send out postcards to any affected voter. Kansans usually get a postcard before an election informing them of their polling place, and those who didn’t get them before an election would likely have been confused, the plaintiffs said at the trial.More than a year and a half later, the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the voters who challenged the Kansas law, filed a motion to hold Kobach in contempt, saying he had failed to send out the postcards and update the county election manual to reflect Robinson’s 2016 order. In a contentious hearing, Kobach said his office had orally instructed county clerks to send out the postcards but could not force them to do anything. Robinson was furious, saying that Kobach had assured her in court that he would send out the postcards.Robinson imposed sanctions on Kobach on Wednesday, saying he had to pay the ACLU for attorney fees and that “any further remedial measures” would be decided when she ruled on the merits of the case.The plaintiffs, a handful of eligible voters unable to get on the rolls, argue that the Kansas law, which went into effect in 2013, violates a 1993 federal law called the National Voter Registration Act. The federal law requires state motor vehicle agencies to offer people the chance to register to vote and only allows them to ask for the minimum amount of information necessary to do so. Robinson’s 2016 preliminary injunction put the law on hold and she oversaw a bench trial in the case in March. A final ruling is expected later this year.Kobach defends the law as necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting in the state, but he has produced just 129 instances in which noncitizens attempted to vote in Kansas. The ACLU says the law is extremely restrictive and unnecessary.“The Secretary of State’s Office will be appealing this decision,” said a Kobach spokesperson after the contempt ruling. “Secretary Kobach has no additional comment at this time.”Robinson’s Wednesday order was scathing, and was particularly directed to Kobach, who made the unusual choice to represent his own office at the trial. She said that Kobach, who is running for governor of Kansas, had made disingenuous arguments to the court and suggested that her 2016 order was dynamic and not law. She also said Kobach had a history of “noncompliance” and “disre spect” for the court in the case. Kobach, who ran President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission until it was disbanded in January, was fined $1,000 for making misleading statements to the court in the case last year.“The judge found that Kris Kobach disobeyed the court’s orders by failing to provide registered voters with consistent information, that he willfully failed to ensure that county elections officials were properly trained, and that he has a ‘history of noncompliance and disrespect for the court’s decisions,’” Dale Ho, the ACLU’s top voting rights lawyer, who faced off against Kobach in court during the trial, said in a statement. “Secretary Kobach likes to talk about the rule of law. Talk is cheap, and his actions speak louder than his words.Bryan Caskey, the state director of elections and a staffer in Kobach’s office, recently filed an affidavit in the case saying that he had instructed county election officials to send out the postcards and had orally done so before trial. Robinson said that was “too little, too late” to avoid a contempt finding. She noted that Kobach had maintained until the trial that he wasn’t obligated to send out the postcards. She said she didn’t find it credible that his staffer had orally instructed counties to send out the postcards before the trial.Robinson also took Kobach to task for suggesting at the trial that it wasn’t his fault that his office didn’t ensure the postcards were sent out. She noted that he was the chief election o fficial in the state and it was his responsibility to follow through on the orders of the court.Kobach had said he complied with the court order because he sent out a separate notice from the court to the 18,000 affected voters ahead of the 2016 election informing them they could vote.Robinson also criticized Kobach for failing to update the county’s election manual to reflect the fact that people applying to vote at the DMV don’t have to prove their citizenship. Caskey testified he was “too busy” to update the document in 2016 and Kobach’s office recently took it offline.Kobach and his lawyers indicated that he didn’t need to update the document because of the preliminary injunction since it wasn’t the final law. Robinson said such a claim was nonsensical, given that it had been nearly two years since her initial preliminary injunction and that her order amounted to current law.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were found guilty on charges of weapons of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights. Wright was also found guilty on a charge of lying to the FBI. The defendants will face a potential life sentence when they come back to court in late June.The jury decided the case after slightly less than a day of deliberations. The three defendants showed little outward emotion as the verdicts were read. Afterward, defense attorneys comforted the defendants’ family members, who did not wish to speak to members of the media.In closing arguments, attorneys for the defendants had accused the FBI of overstepping and targeting the group because of rhetoric that, while hateful, was protected by the First Amendment. The prosecution’s case depended largely on secret recordings made by Dan Day, an FBI informant who masqueraded as a militia member, infiltrating the three men’s group for months. An undercover officer working on behalf of the FBI had also met with Stein, posing as an arms dealer who shared the group’s anti-Muslim beliefs and was willing to build them a bomb.Jurors heard recording after recording of the men expressing a murderous hatred of Muslims, who they called “cockroaches.” “The fucking cockroaches in this country have to go, period,” said Stein , who went by the code name “Orkin Man” in text messages with other militia members. “They are the fucking problem in this country right now. They are the threat in this country right now.”In another recording, the men could be heard mapping out targets on Google Earth, dropping a “pin” labeled “cockroaches” over areas they knew to have a high concentration of Muslims. They eventually settled on a main target: a Garden City apartment complex that’s home to many Somali Muslim immigrants and the mosque where they worship. The prosecution presented evidence that the men had started to collect explosive materials. Per the recordings made by Day, their plan was to detonate bombs at the apartment complex in November 2016. They wanted the explosions to occur during Muslim prayer times when more potential victims would be there, “packed in like sardines,” as Stein put it. The bomb’s shock waves, he hoped, would make “Jello out of their insides.”Defense attorneys had attempted to characterize such comments as mere bluster. But prosecutors pre-empted this line of argument, in part, by calling another militia member to the stand.Brody Benson, part of the Kansas Security Forces militia, held anti-Muslim beliefs himself. “Fucking Islam,” he wrote in a Facebook post in June 2016. “I’m done. Kill them all. Bring on the DOJ.”But Benson testified that when he heard Stein talk about his plan to kill Somali immigrants in Garden City, he knew Stein was for real. “I actually thought it was not ju st talk — it was more of an actual action, action,” Benson said in testimony. “I had a gut feeling that what was just banter back and forth, ranting and everything else, was turning into something more serious and concrete.” “This isn’t a case about the thought police,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Mattivi said during closing arguments. “The defendants plotted to murder dozens of innocent men, women and children. They didn’t just talk. They’re not here because of their words.”In his final comments to the jury, Mattivi focused on a recording of a discussion the men had about what type of shrapnel to pack their bomb with to inflict the most damage. Stein suggested blades for drywall knives. Allen said ball bearings. “Anything that will kill and maim,” Wright said.The men were enthusiastic supporters of Donald Trump, who vilified Muslims during his presidential campaign and has continued to do so while in office. During the plotting, Stein reportedly referred to then-candidate Trump as “the Man.” The men had planned their attack for after the 2016 election, so as not to hurt Trump’s chances of winning. Delaying the attack until then would avoid giving “any ammunition” to their political opponents, Stein said.Trump had frequently spoken out against Muslim refugees in the runup to the 2016 election. Kansas’ top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister, brushed aside a question from HuffPost about what effect the now-president’s words had.“I can’t say whether his rhe toric impacted the case or not,” McAllister, a Trump nominee, said. He later added that this case wasn’t about the rhetoric the defendants used, but about the bomb plot they agreed to participate in.“I don’t view this as a prosecution of speech at all. This was a prosecution of speech coupled with actions,” McAllister said. “Just because you have some words involved doesn’t mean this was about speech. This was about actions, and their speech was to some extent evidence of the actions they were taking.”The Justice Department’s national press office sent out a press release on the case featuring a quote from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, calling the jury verdict a “significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes” and touting DOJ’s commitment to fighting both foreign and domestic terrorist threats.“The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin. That’s not just illegal ― it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it,” Sessions said. “Law enforcement saved lives in this case.”Madihha Ahussain of the group Muslim Advocates praised Wednesday’s verdict, but said Americans must not ignore the “greater context” in which the plan unfolded.“We cannot dismiss the disgusting rhetoric of these militiamen as mere ‘locker room talk’ as the defendants’ counsel argued. The stakes are simply too high,” Ahussain said. “Anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to an unprecedented spike in hate violence and mosque attacks, intense radicalization of white supremacists, and a shocking disregard for the lives of American Muslims.”“This must not become the norm for American discourse,” Ahussain continued. “We must not be divided by hate, but, rather, stand together as a united nation to defend our ideals, values, and beliefs.”HuffPost has been in Wichita, Kansas, to cover this domestic terrorism trial.

UNITED STATES New York,"https://russian.rt.com/world/article/504868-ssha-rossiya-udar-rakety:  The Congressional Research Center published a report on possible problems associated with the concept of a rapid global strike. In accordance with the system developed, Washington must be able to strike for any goal on the planet within an hour. As stated, such an opportunity allegedly can increase the US efforts to ""contain and defeat opponents"", allowing to attack the most important goals at the beginning and during the conflict. The material reports fears that in case of launching conventional missiles on the alleged enemy Russia and China can decide that the United States has used nuclear missiles and mirror it. A lot of potential targets for Washington are south of Russia and China, the ministry's document says. In this regard, the US ""historically planned"" to launch its ballistic missiles over the North Pole, the document says. Thus, an American ballistic missile can theoretically fly over both Russia and China, aiming for the target. ""This type of missiles have a short duration of flight , which increases the likelihood of misunderstanding, because the states have very little time to analyze the situation, assess the threat and respond. In the opinion of skeptics, in such a situation, these states can decide that the only justified option for them is to use their nuclear weapons, ""the report says. A member of the expert council at the Military Industrial Commission under the Russian government, regko Viktor Murakhovsky, in conversation with RT, explained that the concept of an instantaneous global strike envisages the use of funds that the United States does not yet have. ""There is a concept, but there are no technical means for its implementation yet. While there are no ballistic missiles with a non-nuclear warhead for this program. There were plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles in conventional, non-nuclear equipment, but so far they have not been implemented. There are only ground-based Minuteman III nuclear missiles that are located on the continental US and nuclear submarines, ""the expert said. To reduce the risk of"" misunderstanding ""between Russia and the United States in the event Washington launches ballistic missiles, the document proposes a number of measures. Thus, the United States could notify Russia of the launches, ensuring that the missiles are not equipped with a nuclear warhead and move not toward the Russian territory, ""the report's drafters add. It is proposed to convince Russia that the missiles, ""These measures could include military contacts between the two countries, high-level political consultations and an ongoing dialogue to inform Russia about the US plans for the use of these types of missiles, as well as on the noticeable differences between nuclear and non-nuclear ballistic missiles, ""the report of the US Congressional Research Center says. The military expert Alexei Leonkov noted that then the proposed measures - ""this is another fairy tale"" of the United States. ""They suggest that we tie all our defenses on our hands and feet. They say that they will place missiles that are supposedly non-nuclear. But if we carefully read the nuclear doctrine, it is clearly written there that the cruise missiles will be equipped with low-power nuclear warheads. We can not determine at a distance, there is a rocket with a nuclear warhead in the mine or with a conventional one, ""the expert said. Leonkov said that Washington offers Russia knowingly losing rules for the game:"" If Russia starts to agree to these measures, to put it mildly, the death sentence. These proposals are casuistry. Americans are trying to lay down the rules of the game, according to which Russia will certainly lose. We have seen many such examples. Let us recall the situation with missile defense. Initially, when the contract was concluded, it was said that, with this type of weaponry, neither side should have gained an advantage. It was assumed that each side - both the USSR and the US - would have one positional area for missile defense. After that, the Americans safely withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2002 and began to build tactically, primarily the maritime component, ""the expert explained. The concept of the rapid global strike (PGS) began to be developed under the US President George W. Bush, early 2000's. Then its necessity was justified by changing the geopolitical situation. In October 2017, the representative of the Ministry of Defense s Russia Alexander Emelyanov at a joint Russian-Chinese briefing on missile defense in New York said that the United States had begun to create complexes for a rapid global strike. Emelianov stressed that the Russian side perceives the development of a global strike system in the United States as a challenge to its national security and a factor that undermines the world's balance of power. The budget request of the Pentagon for 2019 provides for an increase in funding for the program to create a non-nuclear means of global strikes from $ 201 million this year to $ 278 million in 2019. In addition, it is planned to significantly increase the financing of the global strike program in the next five years - the total amount allocated for it will be $ 1.9 billion. Expert Viktor Murakhovsky said that before the practical implementation of the main goal of the concept is to strike at any point in the world within an hour ""The states are still far away."" For example, the constant duty of aircraft carrier strike groups in some regions. But they can ensure striking within an hour of their aircraft in a very limited space. The strike with cruise missiles - they are subsonic, respectively, at their range of 2500 km they fly for several hours. And they want to receive such a means, which from the continental part of the United States will be able to strike within an hour, where the president's finger pokes. If we talk about an attempt to control the entire space, it does not work out yet, ""the expert stated.14 On April 4, the US Armed Forces together with Fra the United States and Great Britain, on the orders of Trump, attacked Syria with a hundred cruise missiles. Most of the carriers were shot down by Syrian air defense means. The attacks on Syria are held because of reports about the alleged use by the Syrian authorities of chemical weapons in East Gut. At the same time, the evidence is still unrepresented. Even after striking, the media reported that the US president was ready to attack the objects of Russia and Iran in Syria. However, as noted by The Wall Street Journal, Pentagon chief James Mattis advised Trump to a more restrained version of developments. In a number of countries, Washington's actions have caused outrage. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the US missile strikes aggression against a sovereign state. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the strikes on the SAR illegal. He criticized the actions of Washington and China - another permanent member of the UN Security Council, where the situation in Syria was discussed.",New York East Gut James Mattis Wall Street Great Lavrov Bush POLAND Viktor Murakhovsky George Vladimir Putin USSR IRAN Washington SAR Security Council CHINA Ministry Defense Alexei Leonkov UNITED STATES UNITED KINGDOM RUSSIA Emelianov North Trump SYRIA Street Journal Expert Pentagon,"http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2006766/:  Russia and the Western countries reacted differently to the report of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the outcome of the examination of the toxic agent that was used to poison Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia in Salisbury. Actually, the report confirms that it was a nerve agent of the class, codenamed ""Rookie,"" but neither the producer's country nor the laboratory where this chemical agent could create the OPCW experts could establish.


Alexander Shulgin, Russia's permanent representative to the OPCW: ""We first asked a key question to the head of the ministry: is it really true, according to the British, that based on the results of the OPCW expertise, can we judge the country of the toxic chemical used? And we got an absolutely clear unambiguous answer: no, this is not possible. It is not possible to establish, according to the results of the analysis, where the thread stretches, to which country. ""

Nevertheless, at a meeting of the organization in The Hague, the representative of Great Britain insisted that once the conclusions of experts coincided with the conclusions of the British special services, it means that the investigation decided correctly: ""Novice"" came to Salisbury from Russia, nowhere else. But Russian experts believe that not everything is so unambiguous. Three years ago, a patent for the ""Newbie"" was registered in the United States, where the substance was produced. Documents on this have now been submitted to the OPCW Executive Board.

The debate about the ""Novice"" continued in New York. Britain called the Council Safely to report on the findings of the OPCW expert commission, but instead of the facts, the country's permanent representative operated on ""competent opinion"".

In response, Russia's permanent representative Vasily Nebenzia asked to clarify whether allegations of Russia's involvement in the Salisbury incident - with no evidence at all - are pressure on the British investigation.

Trump.The settlement agreement, reached on Wednesday, ends a lawsuit brought by the model, Karen McDougal, and protects the president from being drawn into a legal case involving efforts to buy the silence of women who had stories to tell about him during the 2016 campaign.He still faces another lawsuit from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford is suing to get out of a deal that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, arranged in 2016 for her silence about an alleged affair. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied both women’s stories.In August 2016, A.M.I., which owns The National Enquirer, acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story about Mr. Trump — which it never ran — in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her current career as a fitness specialist.Under the terms of Wednesday’s settlement, A.M.I. has the right to up to $75,000 of any future profits from her story about the alleged affair. According to her lawyer, Peter K. Stris, Ms. McDougal can keep the $150,000 payment, and the publisher will retain the rights to photographs of her that it already has.In a statement, A.M.I. called the settlement an “amicable resolution” and said that under the new agreement it would devote an upcoming magazine cover and fe ature article to Ms. McDougal, and would run several of her fitness columns in its publications.“It’s a total win,” Mr. Stris said in an interview. “We got everything we were fighting for — she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes A.M.I. nothing more.”In a separate interview, Ms. McDougal expressed elation about the end of her “wild ride,” and said she currently had no plans to sell the rights to her story to a new buyer. “It’s one step at a time for me,” she said. “Today, I’m doing my victory dance.”Her lawsuit said that A.M.I., whose chairman, David J. Pecker, is a friend of President Trump’s, misled her into signing the contract. It also claimed that Mr. Cohen had inappropriately intervened in the deal. A.M.I. had denied misleading her.The deal and the extent of Mr. Cohen’s role in it are the subjects of a wide-ranging federal corruption investigation that is, in part, looking into his efforts to protect Mr. Trump’s presidential prospects in 2016.A.M.I. indicated earlier this month that it would fight Ms. McDougal, asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her lawsuit.But that was roughly a week before federal investigators obtained email communications, audio recordings and other documentation from Mr. Cohen during their raid of his office, home and hotel room. Those materials included information about A.M.I. and the McDougal suit, people involved in the case said.The suit also claimed that Mr. Cohen had been secretly involved in the talks b etween A.M.I. and Ms. McDougal’s lawyer at the time, Keith M. Davidson — who emailed Mr. Cohen at the end of the negotiations. A spokesman for Mr. Davidson has said the lawyer “fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal.”A.M.I. also spoke with Mr. Cohen about Ms. McDougal, though it says it did so only as part of its reporting process.Mr. Stris said that before reaching the settlement, he was prepared to answer A.M.I.’s motion to dismiss Ms. McDougal’s case with a request for a limited version of pretrial discovery. The move, compelling both sides to share emails and other records, could have provided information that would not be available through the material the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen. An A.M.I. lawyer, Cameron Stracher, said that he doubted the request would have succeeded, and that avoiding discovery was not a motivating factor in the settlement.The agreement precludes any of that from happening, at least in Ms. McDougal’s civil case against A.M.I., though Mr. Stris said he expected federal investigators to eventually secure everything they needed to fully vet the process behind the deal. “I have tremendous confidence in the men and women of the Southern District of New York,” he said, referring to the federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Stris said he did not rule out taking legal action if more came to light about potentially inappropriate contact between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson during the course of negotiating her deal. The settlement does not bar Ms. McDougal from claims against either of the men in the future. For now, Ms. McDougal said, “I need to relax and get my life back and de-stress.”The initial deal prohibited Ms. McDougal from speaking about her alleged affair, but A.M.I. amended the contract after the election to allow her to answer “legitimate press inquiries,” in response to her complaints that the agreement was overly restrictive. In recent months, she has spoken to The New Yorker and Anderson Cooper of CNN.Separate from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, A.M.I. is facing a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that its $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal was an illegal campaign expenditure. The publisher has denied this and says it acts solely as a news organization with a First Amendment right to run stories — or not run them — as it chooses.",New York Stephanie Clifford Superior Court Anderson Cooper Media Davidson Pecker Stormy Daniels UNITED STATES Keith Donald Cohen District New Michael Angeles Superior Trump David Karen McDougal Cameron Stracher Yorker Los Angeles Southern District Ms,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/nyregion/schneiderman-trump-mueller-pardons.html:  Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York is moving to change New York state law so that he and other local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to President Trump who have been pardoned, according to a letter Mr. Schneiderman sent to the governor and state lawmakers on Wednesday.The move, if approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Legislature, would serve notice that the legal troubles of the president and his aides may continue without the efforts of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Under the plan, Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, seeks to exempt New York’s double jeopardy law from cases involving presidential pardons, according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The current law and the concept of double jeopardy in general mean that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice.Right now, New York state law prevents people from being prosecuted more than once for crimes related to the same act, even if the original prosecution was in federal court. There are already a number of exceptions to the law, and the letter says that Mr. Schneiderman is proposing to add a new one that could be used if federal pardons are issued.Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman have a contentious past. Mr. Schneiderman led a three-year investigation of Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. For his part, the president has dubbed Mr. Schneiderman “the nation’s worst AG.” He has also called him a “lightweight” and a “total loser,” and even tweeted that he wore eyeliner.While Mr. Schneiderman’s jurisdiction does not encompass many of the areas being investigated by Mr. Mueller, a president has no authority to commute sentences or pardon offenses at the state level. That leaves convictions obtained by the state attorney general’s office or any other local prosecutor outside the president’s ability to intervene. The proposal would be structured so that it would not affect people who sought clemency after long jail sentences, an aide to Mr. Schneiderman said.If the proposed law is passed, anyone indicted on state charges after being convicted in federal court and then pardoned would likely challenge the state law in court. But Mr. Schneiderman wrote in the letter that he and his advisers were confident the legislation would withstand any constitutional scrutiny.Even though New York is a reliably blue state, Mr. Schneiderman’s proposal is hardly a foregone conclusion, given the narrow political divide in the State Senate.“We are disturbed by reports that the president is considering pardons of individuals who may have committed serious federal financial, tax, and other crimes — acts that may also violate New York law,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement provided by his office.“We must ensure that if the president, or any president, issues such pardons, we can use the full force of New York’s l aws to bring such individuals to justice.”The White House declined to comment.The president has openly discussed his pardon powers, and reportedly even asked his aides whether he could pardon himself, though one of his lawyers denied it.“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon,” he tweeted last year, “why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.”Just last week, when lawyers for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who is himself the subject of a criminal investigation apparently unrelated to Mr. Mueller’s probe, were in court clashing with prosecutors over a search warrant, Mr. Trump pardoned former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr.Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and a frequent Fox News commentator, said after reading Mr. Schneiderman’s letter that his proposal raises constitutional questions that cannot be answered without examining the legislation.“The first is the specificity of the statute — of the exception — focusing on a limited number of people,” he said, noting that legislatures cannot make laws that apply to specific individuals. But he added that it was possible that such legislation, if properly drawn, would be constitutional.Mr. Schneiderman’s move could set off a battle in the State Senate, where Republicans have narrowly controlled the chamber through alliances with Democrats. Earlier this month, though, most Democrats in the chamber ended a long- running feud, which has left a degree of doubt over long-term control of the body. An April 24 special election in Westchester County could determine who will lead the chamber.The measure would likely be supported by Mr. Cuomo, who is tacking left in the face of a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist. The state’s Assembly has long been a bulwark of liberal ideals.State Senator Todd D. Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said in a statement that he would introduce a bill to “close the glaring loophole” highlighted by Mr. Schneiderman’s letter. Similar legislation will be introduced in the Assembly.Mr. Schneiderman’s move is likely to inflame allies of Mr. Trump, who see Mr. Schneiderman as an opportunist bent on making political hay, and whom they see as unlikely to treat Mr. Trump fairly.This is hardly the first time Mr. Schneiderman has challenged Mr. Trump.A month before the 2016 election, his office ordered Mr. Trump’s foundation to stop raising money in New York amid scrutiny over Mr. Trump’s claims about charitable giving. The $25 million settlement over Trump University came shortly after the election. Mr. Schneiderman called the settlement “a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”The attorney general’s office has also investigated Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, who was indicted on federal charges last year, though he deferred his inquiry amid t he federal investigation.The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution has a double jeopardy clause that says “nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” But that applies to multiple prosecutions of the same federal offense.The states are almost evenly split between those that have additional double jeopardy protections at the state level and those that do not. And Mr. Schneiderman has successfully backed changes to the double jeopardy law before. In 2011, the state closed what was known as the “Helmsley loophole,” named for the headline-grabbing hotelier Leona Helmsley, allowing it to prosecute tax cheats who had already been prosecuted federally.“New York’s statutory protections could result in the unintended and unjust consequence of insulating someone pardoned for serious federal crimes from subsequent prosecution for state crimes,” Mr. Schneiderman writes in his letter, “even if that person was never tried or convicted in federal court, and never served a single day in federal prison.”Whether Mr. Schneiderman’s office would even seek to become involved in a criminal prosecution of Mr. Trump or his aides remains to be seen. But his move only adds to Mr. Trump’s legal problems.Several of Mr. Trump’s former aides have pleaded guilty in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, including Rick Gates, a former campaign adviser, and Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser. Earlier this month, the Southern District of New York, an office of the Justice Department outside of Mr. Mueller’s, revealed it was investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Trump has made his feelings about these investigations plain in a recent tweet that said, simply, “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”",New York Fifth Amendment Lewis Libby TOTAL Leona Libby Jr Flynn Mueller Alan Helmsley Harvard Law Law School UNITED STATES RUSSIA Assembly Donald Times White House Cohen Fox News Dick Cheney Michael Cynthia Nixon University Just Dershowitz Trump Rick Gates LEAKS Paul Southern District Robert Manafort,"http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-bush-family-rose-to-power-2015-3:  Over the course of five generations, the Bush and Walker clans have amassed fortunes and political power beyond belief.

He blamed the news media for spreading a narrative that he said portrays him as being afraid to stand up to Russia.“There’s been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump,” the president said, citing increased U.S. military spending among his examples. “With the media, no matter what I did, it’s never tough enough, because that’s their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there’s been nobody tougher than Donald Trump.Trump mentioned the joint U.S., French and British military operation last weekend that struck several sites in Syria to punish the Russian-backed government of President Bashar Assad for an apparent chemical attack that killed civilians. Trump said the strike was “absolute precision.”Trump had largely avoided criticizing Russia, leaving the harsh rhetoric and sanctions announcements to others in the administration. But he began to criticize Russia on Twitter after the apparent chemical attack this month that spawned images of Syrian adults gasping for air and being hosed off.Still, Trump said he would prefer good relations with Russia and other nation s.“If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.

The leaders had spent the past two days discussing such issues as North Korea and trade — and playing golf.“If we got along with other nations, that’s good, not bad,” Trump said.A day earlier, an internal White House quarrel over the timing of new Russia sanctions played out in public after Trump’s new economic adviser suggested U.N.

The man ""suffers from multiple sclerosis since 2006, diagnosis considered certain,"" conclude the doctors in their report ""The current care (...) is not incompatible with the detention. However, the experts insist that Tariq Ramadan, if he remained in detention, will continue to benefit from access to care "", including its drug treatment and its four weekly physiotherapy sessions, they still write. Muslim intellectual, saying he suffered from multiple sclerosis and neuropathy, had from the beginning contested his incarceration, but on February 22, the Paris Court of Appeal had validated his detention, to the chagrin of his supporters who have been denouncing an ""injustice"" ever since. According to the report issued on Wednesday, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, made in Qatar in November 2014 and then in London in 2016, was confirmed in Paris ""in March 2018, the hospital of Salpêtrière by two neurologists of recognized competence "". ""There has been no recent outbreak of the disease"", they note, saying that ""stress can increase symptoms."" However, according to these experts, no argument ""allows to retain the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. of s lower limbs ""alleged by Tariq Ramadan. According to his wife, he goes to the parlor of his wheelchair prison. Reporting ""a reactionary depressive state to detention"", doctors believe that the headaches and disruption of the walk complained of by the intellectual are ""most likely"" physical disorders related to ""his current situation"". After complaining of these symptoms, he has been hospitalized at least twice since his incarceration. But his opponents mostly see a comedy for his release. Beyond the medical, the case of Tariq Ramadan has further thickened. At the beginning of March, a third complainant reported herself, having suffered multiple rapes between 2013 and 2014 in France, Brussels and London. This Lilloise described in her complaint very violent sexual intercourse under duress, most often in hotels on the sidelines of the preacher's successful conferences, in a scenario similar to that described by the other complainants. The investigators analyze the audio recordings and the messages she gave them, and a black dress spotted with semen, according to a source close to the file. On Wednesday, an expert report was ordered by the judges to check whether this spot corresponds to Mr. Ramadan's DNA, the source added. According to Libération, who was able to consult several elements of this file, the preacher could change the line of defense concerning this affair and In Switzerland, a woman also lodged a complaint last week against Ramadan, accusing her of raping her and sequestrating her in 2009 in a hotel room in Geneva. At the beginning of April, the Belgian courts had also announced that the accused had paid a woman to silence their ""relationship"". The detention of this grandson of the founder of the Islamist brotherhood of the Muslim Brotherhood caused a stir at within the Muslim community. Some have denounced a ""double standard"", even a ""conspiracy"" against one of the few media figures of European Islam, accused by its detractors of fundamentalism camouflaged under a reformist speech.His star had however already begun to fade and few community leaders have shown their support. Nevertheless, the movement of the Muslims of France (ex-UOIF) marked the spirits at the end of March when its president, Amar Lasfar, expressed the hope that Tariq Ramadan, whose ""thought remains intact"", will soon be ""released"" from prison and ""whitened"".",UOIF FRANCE BELGIUM Court Appeal QATAR Amar Lasfar Tariq Ramadan European Islam UNITED KINGDOM SWITZERLAND Brotherhood,"http://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/tv/high-fines-herbes-le-csa-s-autosaisit-19-04-2018-7673331.php:  The new show of the chain Viceland, ""High & herbs"", devoted to cannabis, really put the CSA in firecracker.

UNITED STATES Trump Donald,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5631845/Playboy-playmate-claims-year-long-affair-Trump-free-tell-story.html:  Former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal has reached a settlement that frees her to tell her story of an alleged affair with President Trump – without relinquishing the $150,000 she got late in the presidential campaign for the rights.American Media Inc., which owns the National Enquirer, keeps the rights to up to $75,000 from any future profits of the story.It also maintains the rights to photos it has of McDougal. The settlement comes after an FBI raid on Donald Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen brought in documents and other material related to the settlement negotiation, which Cohen took part in.'It's a total win,' her lawyer, Peter Stris, told the New York Times. 'We got everything we were fighting for — she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes A.M.I. nothing more.' 'Today, I'm doing my victory dance,' McDougal told the paper.AMI bought the rights to McDougal's story in August 2016 – as the campaign contended with a series of stories by women who claimed they were groped or had other unonconsensual encounters with Trump.McDougal came forward with her story after porn star Stormy Daniels launched a public campaign to get relief from her own non-disclosure agreement, which involved Trump but was signed by Cohen.She told CNN in a sit-down interview about what she claims was a year-long affair with Trump during his marriage to future first lady Melania Trump.'After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me,' she said, in one explosive statement.'But I looked at him and I said, 'That's not me. I'm not that kind of girl,'' McDougal recalled. 'And he said 'Oh,' and he said, 'You're really special.' And I was like, 'Thank you.'' But she didn't only dish dirt on Trump. ''There was a real relationship there,' McDougal said. 'There were feelings between the two of us.' AMI chairman David Pecker is a friend of Trump's who has visited the White House. His company has been accused of 'catch and kill' deals to get rights to stories and kill them as favors. The publication vigorously denies the charges, and says the stories didn't merit publication.Stris told the Times as part of a discovery motion he intended to submit questions to President Trump and would have sought emails and records about the deal",Media Michael Cohen Stormy Daniels Thank FBI AMI National Enquirer UNITED STATES White House David Pecker Stris Melania Donald Times Playboy Trump Karen McDougal,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/us/politics/karen-mcdougal-american-media-settlement.html:  The tabloid news company American Media Inc. agreed to let a former Playboy model out of a contract that had kept her from talking freely about an alleged affair with Donald J. Trump.The settlement agreement, reached on Wednesday, ends a lawsuit brought by the model, Karen McDougal, and protects the president from being drawn into a legal case involving efforts to buy the silence of women who had stories to tell about him during the 2016 campaign.He still faces another lawsuit from Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford is suing to get out of a deal that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, arranged in 2016 for her silence about an alleged affair. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied both women’s stories.In August 2016, A.M.I., which owns The National Enquirer, acquired the rights to Ms. McDougal’s story about Mr. Trump — which it never ran — in return for $150,000 and commitments to use its magazines to promote her current career as a fitness specialist.Under the terms of Wednesday’s settlement, A.M.I. has the right to up to $75,000 of any future profits from her story about the alleged affair. According to her lawyer, Peter K. Stris, Ms. McDougal can keep the $150,000 payment, and the publisher will retain the rights to photographs of her that it already has.In a statement, A.M.I. called the settlement an “amicable resolution” and said that under the new agreement it would devote an upcoming magazine cover and fe ature article to Ms. McDougal, and would run several of her fitness columns in its publications.“It’s a total win,” Mr. Stris said in an interview. “We got everything we were fighting for — she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes A.M.I. nothing more.”In a separate interview, Ms. McDougal expressed elation about the end of her “wild ride,” and said she currently had no plans to sell the rights to her story to a new buyer. “It’s one step at a time for me,” she said. “Today, I’m doing my victory dance.”Her lawsuit said that A.M.I., whose chairman, David J. Pecker, is a friend of President Trump’s, misled her into signing the contract. It also claimed that Mr. Cohen had inappropriately intervened in the deal. A.M.I. had denied misleading her.The deal and the extent of Mr. Cohen’s role in it are the subjects of a wide-ranging federal corruption investigation that is, in part, looking into his efforts to protect Mr. Trump’s presidential prospects in 2016.A.M.I. indicated earlier this month that it would fight Ms. McDougal, asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her lawsuit.But that was roughly a week before federal investigators obtained email communications, audio recordings and other documentation from Mr. Cohen during their raid of his office, home and hotel room. Those materials included information about A.M.I. and the McDougal suit, people involved in the case said.The suit also claimed that Mr. Cohen had been secretly involved in the talks b etween A.M.I. and Ms. McDougal’s lawyer at the time, Keith M. Davidson — who emailed Mr. Cohen at the end of the negotiations. A spokesman for Mr. Davidson has said the lawyer “fulfilled his obligations and zealously advocated for Ms. McDougal.”A.M.I. also spoke with Mr. Cohen about Ms. McDougal, though it says it did so only as part of its reporting process.Mr. Stris said that before reaching the settlement, he was prepared to answer A.M.I.’s motion to dismiss Ms. McDougal’s case with a request for a limited version of pretrial discovery. The move, compelling both sides to share emails and other records, could have provided information that would not be available through the material the F.B.I. seized from Mr. Cohen. An A.M.I. lawyer, Cameron Stracher, said that he doubted the request would have succeeded, and that avoiding discovery was not a motivating factor in the settlement.The agreement precludes any of that from happening, at least in Ms. McDougal’s civil case against A.M.I., though Mr. Stris said he expected federal investigators to eventually secure everything they needed to fully vet the process behind the deal. “I have tremendous confidence in the men and women of the Southern District of New York,” he said, referring to the federal prosecutors investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Stris said he did not rule out taking legal action if more came to light about potentially inappropriate contact between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson during the course of negotiating her deal. The settlement does not bar Ms. McDougal from claims against either of the men in the future. For now, Ms. McDougal said, “I need to relax and get my life back and de-stress.”The initial deal prohibited Ms. McDougal from speaking about her alleged affair, but A.M.I. amended the contract after the election to allow her to answer “legitimate press inquiries,” in response to her complaints that the agreement was overly restrictive. In recent months, she has spoken to The New Yorker and Anderson Cooper of CNN.Separate from the federal investigation into Mr. Cohen, A.M.I. is facing a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that its $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal was an illegal campaign expenditure. The publisher has denied this and says it acts solely as a news organization with a First Amendment right to run stories — or not run them — as it chooses.",New York Stephanie Clifford Superior Court Anderson Cooper Media Davidson Pecker Stormy Daniels UNITED STATES Keith Donald Cohen District New Michael Angeles Superior Trump David Karen McDougal Cameron Stracher Yorker Los Angeles Southern District Ms,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/nyregion/schneiderman-trump-mueller-pardons.html:  Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman of New York is moving to change New York state law so that he and other local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to President Trump who have been pardoned, according to a letter Mr. Schneiderman sent to the governor and state lawmakers on Wednesday.The move, if approved by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Legislature, would serve notice that the legal troubles of the president and his aides may continue without the efforts of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Under the plan, Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, seeks to exempt New York’s double jeopardy law from cases involving presidential pardons, according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The current law and the concept of double jeopardy in general mean that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice.Right now, New York state law prevents people from being prosecuted more than once for crimes related to the same act, even if the original prosecution was in federal court. There are already a number of exceptions to the law, and the letter says that Mr. Schneiderman is proposing to add a new one that could be used if federal pardons are issued.Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman have a contentious past. Mr. Schneiderman led a three-year investigation of Trump University that resulted in a $25 million settlement. For his part, the president has dubbed Mr. Schneiderman “the nation’s worst AG.” He has also called him a “lightweight” and a “total loser,” and even tweeted that he wore eyeliner.While Mr. Schneiderman’s jurisdiction does not encompass many of the areas being investigated by Mr. Mueller, a president has no authority to commute sentences or pardon offenses at the state level. That leaves convictions obtained by the state attorney general’s office or any other local prosecutor outside the president’s ability to intervene. The proposal would be structured so that it would not affect people who sought clemency after long jail sentences, an aide to Mr. Schneiderman said.If the proposed law is passed, anyone indicted on state charges after being convicted in federal court and then pardoned would likely challenge the state law in court. But Mr. Schneiderman wrote in the letter that he and his advisers were confident the legislation would withstand any constitutional scrutiny.Even though New York is a reliably blue state, Mr. Schneiderman’s proposal is hardly a foregone conclusion, given the narrow political divide in the State Senate.“We are disturbed by reports that the president is considering pardons of individuals who may have committed serious federal financial, tax, and other crimes — acts that may also violate New York law,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement provided by his office.“We must ensure that if the president, or any president, issues such pardons, we can use the full force of New York’s l aws to bring such individuals to justice.”The White House declined to comment.The president has openly discussed his pardon powers, and reportedly even asked his aides whether he could pardon himself, though one of his lawyers denied it.“While all agree the U.S. President has the complete power to pardon,” he tweeted last year, “why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.”Just last week, when lawyers for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who is himself the subject of a criminal investigation apparently unrelated to Mr. Mueller’s probe, were in court clashing with prosecutors over a search warrant, Mr. Trump pardoned former Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby Jr.Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and a frequent Fox News commentator, said after reading Mr. Schneiderman’s letter that his proposal raises constitutional questions that cannot be answered without examining the legislation.“The first is the specificity of the statute — of the exception — focusing on a limited number of people,” he said, noting that legislatures cannot make laws that apply to specific individuals. But he added that it was possible that such legislation, if properly drawn, would be constitutional.Mr. Schneiderman’s move could set off a battle in the State Senate, where Republicans have narrowly controlled the chamber through alliances with Democrats. Earlier this month, though, most Democrats in the chamber ended a long- running feud, which has left a degree of doubt over long-term control of the body. An April 24 special election in Westchester County could determine who will lead the chamber.The measure would likely be supported by Mr. Cuomo, who is tacking left in the face of a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist. The state’s Assembly has long been a bulwark of liberal ideals.State Senator Todd D. Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said in a statement that he would introduce a bill to “close the glaring loophole” highlighted by Mr. Schneiderman’s letter. Similar legislation will be introduced in the Assembly.Mr. Schneiderman’s move is likely to inflame allies of Mr. Trump, who see Mr. Schneiderman as an opportunist bent on making political hay, and whom they see as unlikely to treat Mr. Trump fairly.This is hardly the first time Mr. Schneiderman has challenged Mr. Trump.A month before the 2016 election, his office ordered Mr. Trump’s foundation to stop raising money in New York amid scrutiny over Mr. Trump’s claims about charitable giving. The $25 million settlement over Trump University came shortly after the election. Mr. Schneiderman called the settlement “a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.”The attorney general’s office has also investigated Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, who was indicted on federal charges last year, though he deferred his inquiry amid t he federal investigation.The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution has a double jeopardy clause that says “nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” But that applies to multiple prosecutions of the same federal offense.The states are almost evenly split between those that have additional double jeopardy protections at the state level and those that do not. And Mr. Schneiderman has successfully backed changes to the double jeopardy law before. In 2011, the state closed what was known as the “Helmsley loophole,” named for the headline-grabbing hotelier Leona Helmsley, allowing it to prosecute tax cheats who had already been prosecuted federally.“New York’s statutory protections could result in the unintended and unjust consequence of insulating someone pardoned for serious federal crimes from subsequent prosecution for state crimes,” Mr. Schneiderman writes in his letter, “even if that person was never tried or convicted in federal court, and never served a single day in federal prison.”Whether Mr. Schneiderman’s office would even seek to become involved in a criminal prosecution of Mr. Trump or his aides remains to be seen. But his move only adds to Mr. Trump’s legal problems.Several of Mr. Trump’s former aides have pleaded guilty in Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, including Rick Gates, a former campaign adviser, and Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser. Earlier this month, the Southern District of New York, an office of the Justice Department outside of Mr. Mueller’s, revealed it was investigating Mr. Cohen.Mr. Trump has made his feelings about these investigations plain in a recent tweet that said, simply, “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”",New York Fifth Amendment Lewis Libby TOTAL Leona Libby Jr Flynn Mueller Alan Helmsley Harvard Law Law School UNITED STATES RUSSIA Assembly Donald Times White House Cohen Fox News Dick Cheney Michael Cynthia Nixon University Just Dershowitz Trump Rick Gates LEAKS Paul Southern District Robert Manafort,"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/business/guns-dicks-sporting-goods.html:  Dick’s Sporting Goods plans to destroy the assault-style rifles and accessories it agreed to take off its shelves in February instead of returning them to manufacturers.It is the latest action taken by the Pennsylvania retailer that agreed to ban the sale of assault-style rifles at its 35 Field & Stream stores, and to stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone younger than 21.Since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February that left 17 students and staff members dead, corporations have quickly responded to the public’s growing demand for responsible gun control measures. Several retailers agreed to stop selling firearms to consumers younger than 21. Among them are Walmart, the nation’s largest gun seller; L.L. Bean; and Kroger, which said it would restrict gun sales at its Fred Meyer stores.Walmart also agreed to stop selling toys online that look like assault-style rifles. And Kroger announced in March that it would stop selling “assault-rifle themed periodicals.”“It’s a very good barometer of where the public stands,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization that seeks to end gun violence. “Corporations tend to reflect their customers.”The news that Dick’s Sporting Goods would destroy the weapons was first reported last week in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A spokesman told the paper that the company was in the process of destroying the firearms and accessories no longer for sale, “ in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations.”In a significant move by a major bank last month, Citigroup said it would restrict the sale of firearms by its business partners, including those sold to people younger than 21 or people who have not passed background checks. (The restrictions apply to clients who, among other things, raise capital via Citigroup or offer Citigroup-backed credit cards.)Many Americans have warned corporate America on social media about their feelings toward gun violence, even threatening to boycott brands. Corporations have cut sponsorships and partnerships with the National Rifle Association, which lobbies on behalf of gun makers and raised millions of dollars for the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Hertz and Avis announced they would end discount programs for the N.R.A.’s five million members. Delta and United also issued statements asking the N.R.A. to remove their information from its website.“The message you are getting is that the gun lobby does not represent where the public stands on this issue,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “The N.R.A. does not represent mainstream America.”A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined to comment on the recent moves by retailers, including the decision by Dick’s Sporting Goods to destroy the unsold weapons.Edward W. Stack, the chief executive of Dick’s, acknowledged in February that the company sold a shotgun on Nov. 17 to Nikolas Cruz, the Parkland gunman. “It was not the g un, nor type of gun, he used in the shooting,” Mr. Stack said in a statement. “But it could have been.” The company previously stopped selling assault-style weapons at Dick’s stores after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.Under federal law, a person must be at least 21 to buy a handgun from a firearms dealer.

Nearly 80 percent, however, support a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, and ""67 percent think undocumented immigrants should be able to purchase health insurance on the California state exchange.""The Haas Institute concedes in its news release that ""Californians hold some contradictory and troubling views.""Its suggested fix: ""[O]utreach and information campaigns anchored in narrative s that point Californians towards their shared progressive values and identity.""PROFESSOR CALLS BARBARA BUSH 'AMAZING RACIST,' SAYS SHE'S HAPPY 'WITCH IS DEAD'But the results show that many Californians already have a sense of identity and values, outreach campaign or not. For example, 45 pecent of Californians said that being Christian is an ""important part of being American,"" and nearly 40 percent don't want to limit law enforcement cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to the survey.The survey comes as several California cities and counties back the Trump administration's lawsuit against the state's pro-illegal immigration sanctuary policies.On Wednesday, California Gov. Jerry Brown announced plans to deploy “up to 400” members of the state's National Guard troops “to combat” criminal activity along the U.S.-Mexico border — after President Donald Trump slammed the Democratic leader a day earlier for “trying to back out” of an earlier pledge to do so.CALIFORNIA HAS WORST QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE US, REPORT FINDSBrown issued an order that the National Guard be sent to help “combat criminal gangs, human traffickers and illegal firearm and drug smugglers — within the state, along the coast and at the U.S.-Mexico border.”  But the governor sent military personnel on the condition that “the California National Guard will not enforce immigration laws or participate in the construction of any new border barrier.”Brown's office also said the T rump administration would pick up the tab for the California deployment, the Los Angeles Times reported.For his part, Trump tweeted Wednesday that Californians are tiring of their government.""There is a Revolution going on in California,"" he wrote.
