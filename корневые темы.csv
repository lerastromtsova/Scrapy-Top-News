The CEC said that this year the current head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin won with a significant advantage. Vladimir Putin's re-election was already greeted by a number of foreign leaders. However, there were those who questioned the honesty of the process. Among those who congratulated the current head of Russia on the victory in the election - Chairman of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In his telegram, it is noted that ""at present, China-Russia relations of all-round strategic cooperation and partnership have reached an unprecedented high level."" In addition, the Foreign Ministry of China noted that they are preparing for the future visit of the Russian president. Presumably, it may take place in June as part of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Qingdao. Putin's dinner talks about the level of people's high trust, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko believes. ""This result demonstrates the high confidence and support of the citizens of Russia for the sustainable social and economic development of the country, strengthening its authority on the international arena,"" the congratulatory message says. Venezuelan and Nicolas Maduro and Raul Castro expressed condolences. The leader of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said that the result of voting in Russia was convincing: ""This victory testifies to your high political authority and active support of your course directed to ensure stability, law and order in the country, implementation of large-scale reforms, implementation of long-term social programs that contribute to the welfare of the people, ""it follows from Aliyev's message. Moldovan President Igor Dodon in his congratulations noted that today"" a strong Russia is needed not only for Russians "" President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier congratulated Vladimir Putin and I congratulate you and the citizens of the Russian Federation on their re-election, I wish you success during the new term, ""the website says. The leaders of other countries: Kyrgyzstan - Sooronbai Jeenbekov, Kazakhstan - Nursultan Nazarbayev, Egypt - Abdel Fattah as-Sisi, Armenia - Serzh Sargsyan, Iran - Hasan Rukhani and others. Wishing success for the next period of Putin's presidency. Serbian leader Alexander Vučić and Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said: ""The result you have achieved only confirms the wide support that you have for all the complex reforms that you have so far carried out successfully or are only intending to accomplish Odile. This shows that citizens see you as a true leader who is ready to meet all the challenges, ""Brnabic said."" Western countries have congratulations. On telephone conversations: today and tomorrow there will be a number of conversations. What comes through the diphinal ... until I would not talk, call the individual countries, then we will give generalizing information, ""the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitri told journalists Iy Peskov. Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum. On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair.

According to media reports, the company also wants to deduct its self-driving vehicles from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and the Canadian Toronto.Uber tests including in Arizona self-driving cars and trucks. It is one of several dozen American U companies, including Google's subsidiary Waymo, which tests driverless driving on shared routes. Our robotic car program was burdened with problems right from the start. On the very first day of testing in San Francisco, a Uber car was filmed driving a red traffic light and over a year ago Waymo complained that Uber used stolen robotic car technology. The lawsuit was settled recently, but weighed down the Uber program. It's not the first fatal accident involving a self-drive car. Already in 2016 an accident with a Tesla had occurred. The driver of a Tesla sports car had been in Florida and had used the self-drive mode of the vehicle. In a collision at a crossroads with a truck, the driver had died. The man apparently had his hands off the wheel at the time, though Tesla had warned that their vehicles were not yet able to fully take control of the car. Vehicles like the converted Uber cars, on the other hand, are meant to work without human involvement to drive, even if at present the security drivers often intervene. California recently also allowed the operation of robotic cars with steering wheel and pedals that are controlled solely by computer or radio. Proponents of robotic cars argue that about 90 percent of traffic accidents were due to human error and technology autonomous vehicles will prevent them in the future. However, the industry also assumes that there will be fatal accidents with self-driving cars. With information from Katharina Wilhelm, ARD Studio Los Angeles",Sino Tesla California Volvo UNITED STATES Katharina Wilhelm Phoenix Tempe Self Pittsburgh Google Toronto CANADA SWEDEN Dara Florida Arizona Waymo San Francisco Company,"United States | Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Arizona Pedestrian | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html |  SAN FRANCISCO — Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state’s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber — and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulati on. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.[Read more on how Arizona became a destination for self-driving car tests.]But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona’s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn’t reached a full floor vote.“This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America’s roads,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company’s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.”Tempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.“We needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,” Doug Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a “business-friendly and low regulatory environment” had helped the state’s economy.Even when an Uber self-driving car and another vehicle collided in Tempe in March 2017, city police and Mr. Ducey said that extra safety regulations weren’t necessary; the other driver was at fault, not the self-driving vehicle.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe’s ma yor, called Uber’s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a “responsible step” and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor “provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.”In California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine “the vehicle’s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.”Since late last year, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has been using cars without a human in the driver’s seat to pick up and drop off passengers in Arizona.Most testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called “disengage ments.”Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times — an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google’s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber’s cars have covered 3 million miles.In 2016, a man driving his Tesla using Autopilot, the car company’s self-driving feature, died on a state highway in Florida when his car crashed into a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road. Federal regulators later ruled there were no defects in the system to cause the accident.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who h as been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.“We’ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,” he said. “They’re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.”",California Lyft Volvo Highway Traffic UNITED STATES Richard Blumenthal Tempe Safety State University Ariz Senate Pittsburgh SAN FRANCISCO Google Toronto Autopilot Michael Bennett Silicon Valley Doug Ducey Florida Democrat Connecticut Arizona Waymo House Daniel Scarpinato Elaine Herzberg National San Francisco Cruise Jessica Gonzalez Sarah Abboud

This was stated by British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, speaking in Brussels during a meeting with the foreign ministers of the European Union. According to Johnson, ""first they (Russians) say that they never produced"" Novice ""(a nerve agent used in poisoning Skripal and his daughter), and another time they say that they produced the ""Novice"", but his stockpiles were destroyed, but some of them mysteriously found themselves in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, or even in America or the United Kingdom. ""According to him , Britain faced ""a classic Russian strategy aimed at hiding the needle of truth in a haystack of lies."" However, Johnson said, 12 years after the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in London, the Russians will not be able to deceive any more. Johnson said that ""there is hardly a country here at the table in Brussels, which in recent years would not have been affected by any malicious act or the destructive behavior of Russia, so our strength and determination of our European friends are so impressive. ""The Minister noted that he was"" inspired by the British support for the Salisbury incident ""on the part of the Allies. In his estimation, this is partly because the UK acts in accordance with its obligations under the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons. ""It looks like a great contrast to how the Russians behave,"" said Boris Johnson. EU foreign affairs and security policy spokesman Federica Mogherini, speaking on Monday (March 19) to reporters on arrival at the Council of Foreign Ministers of the EU , said that after the report of Boris Johnson at the meeting of EU ministers, the EU's updated position on the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia in Salisbury will be adopted.",Federica RUSSIA UNITED STATES BELGIUM Salisbury UNITED KINGDOM Sergei Skripal Allies Boris Johnson CZECH REPUBLIC Treaty Prohibition SLOVAKIA Alexander Litvinenko SWEDEN,"United Kingdom | EU demands Russia urgently hands over all information on Novichok nerve agent programme | http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/eu-russia-spy-poisoning-latest-novichok-nerve-agent-programme-handover-putin-uk-a8262966.html |  The European Union has demanded that the Russian government hand over for scrutiny all information about the nerve agent that allegedly poisoned a former spy on British soil.At a meeting in Brussels on Monday the EU’s 28 foreign ministers condemned the “reckless and illegal” poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal and said information about the Novichok nerve agent should be handed over to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigation.  The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",UNITED STATES BELGIUM SPAIN Sergei OPCW SLOVAKIA Russ Alexander Litvinenko CZECH REPUBLIC SWEDEN RUSSIA Vladimir Putin Chemical Weapons Convention Salisbury UNITED KINGDOM Federica Mogherini Boris Johnson Kingdom March Alfonso Dastis Novichok Yulia Skripal
California Volvo Highway Traffic Elaine Herzberg Tempe San Francisco Pittsburgh Autopilot Toronto,"United States | Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Arizona Pedestrian | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html |  SAN FRANCISCO — Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state’s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber — and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulati on. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.[Read more on how Arizona became a destination for self-driving car tests.]But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona’s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn’t reached a full floor vote.“This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America’s roads,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company’s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.”Tempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.“We needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,” Doug Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a “business-friendly and low regulatory environment” had helped the state’s economy.Even when an Uber self-driving car and another vehicle collided in Tempe in March 2017, city police and Mr. Ducey said that extra safety regulations weren’t necessary; the other driver was at fault, not the self-driving vehicle.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe’s ma yor, called Uber’s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a “responsible step” and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor “provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.”In California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine “the vehicle’s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.”Since late last year, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has been using cars without a human in the driver’s seat to pick up and drop off passengers in Arizona.Most testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called “disengage ments.”Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times — an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google’s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber’s cars have covered 3 million miles.In 2016, a man driving his Tesla using Autopilot, the car company’s self-driving feature, died on a state highway in Florida when his car crashed into a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road. Federal regulators later ruled there were no defects in the system to cause the accident.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who h as been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.“We’ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,” he said. “They’re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.”",California Lyft Volvo Highway Traffic UNITED STATES Richard Blumenthal Tempe Safety State University Ariz Senate Pittsburgh SAN FRANCISCO Google Toronto Autopilot Michael Bennett Silicon Valley Doug Ducey Florida Democrat Connecticut Arizona Waymo House Daniel Scarpinato Elaine Herzberg National San Francisco Cruise Jessica Gonzalez Sarah Abboud,"United Kingdom | Self-driving Uber car runs over and kills a pedestrian in Arizona | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5519433/Self-driving-Uber-car-runs-kills-pedestrian-Arizona.html |  A self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian as she was crossing the road in the first fatality involving the controversial fleet of autonomous vehicles.Elaine Herzberg, 49, was hit by an SUV around 10pm on Sunday in Tempe, Arizona, when she was walking her bicycle outside of a crosswalk.She was immediately rushed to the hospital where she died from her injuries, ABC 15 reported.Tempe Police say the SUV was in autonomous mode at the time of the crash but that a vehicle operator was also behind the wheel. The accident is the first time a pedestrian has been killed on a public road by an autonomous car, which has been praised as the safer alternative to a traditional car.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company is aware of the incident and is 'fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation'. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi offered his condolences to the victim's family on Twitter on Monday afternoon, and reiterated that the company will be working with local law enforcement to figure out what happened.The ride-share service has since paused its self-driving car operations in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto.Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell released a statement on Twitter on Monday afternon in support of the halt.   He wrote: 'The City of Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer in many areas, including transportation options for disabled res idents. 'Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe Police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.'I support the step that Uber has take to temporarily suspend testing in Tempe until this event is fully examined and understood. That is a responsible step to take at this time' This is not the first time Uber has grounded its fleet of self-driving cars. In March 2017, an autonomous Volvo SUV got into accident when the other vehicle 'failed to yield' while making a left turn, according to police. 'The vehicles collided causing the autonomous vehicle to roll onto its side. There were no serious injuries,' Tempe police spokeswoman Josie Montenegros said at the time. The only known death involving a self-driving car and a driver was when Tesla driver Joshua Brown was killed in 2016 while operating the company's Autopilot software.However, this crash occurred only after Brown ignored repeated warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel. Tesla has stated that Autopilot is a driver assistance feature, not a replacement for a human driver.The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday that it will be sending teams to Tempe to investigate the accident.In a statement, the NHTSA said it is 'in contact with Uber, Volvo, federal, state and loc al authorities regarding the incident' and will take appropriate action. Meanwhile, other states are already taking action. California regulators ordered Uber to stop its newly launched self-driving car service in San Francisco until it gets a state permit.In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, DMV officials wrote that Uber 'must cease' deploying the cars or face unspecified legal action.Uber knew about the permit requirement but argued that its cars do not meet the state's definition of an 'autonomous vehicle' because they require a person behind the wheel to monitor and intervene if needed.  In September, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao released new guidelines that permit more testing of self-driving cars and address regulation between the federal government and states.Chao argued that self-driving technology could also improve mobility for the elderly, disabled and other restricted populations.But the non-profit Consumer Watchdog has warned that roads are being turned 'into private laboratories for robot cars with no regard for our safety.'Not much information has been released about Herzberg.

Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s CEO, tweeted: “Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona. We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.”Uber has been testing its self-driving cars in numerous states and temporarily suspended its vehicles in Arizona last year after a crash involving one of its vehicles, a Volvo SUV. When the company first began testing its self-driving cars in California in 2016, the vehicles were caught running red lights, leading to a high-profile dispute between state regulators and the San Francisco-based corporation.Police identified the victim as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg and said she was walking outside of the crosswalk with a bicycle when she was hit at around 10pm on Sunday. Images from the scene showed a damaged bike. The 2017 Volvo SUV was traveling at roughly 40 miles an hour, and it did not appear that the car slowed down as it approached the woman, said Tempe sergeant Ronald Elcock.Elcock said he had watched footage of the collision, which has not been released to the public. He also identified the operator of the car as Rafael Vasquez, 44, and said he was cooperative and there were no signs of impairment.The self-driving technology is supposed to detect pedestrians, cyclists and others and prevent crashes.John M Simpson, privacy and technology project director with Consumer Watchdog, said the collision highlighted the need for tighter regulations of the nascent technology.“The robot cars cannot accurately predict human behavior, and the real problem comes in the interaction between humans and the robot vehicles,” said Simpson, whose advocacy group called for a national moratorium on autonomous car testing in the wake of the deadly collision.Simpson said he was unaware of any previous fatal crashes involving an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian.Tesla Motors was the first to disclose a death involving a self-driving car in 2016 when the sensors of a Model S driving in autopilot mode failed to detect a large white 18-wheel truck and trailer crossing the highway. The car drove full speed under the trailer, causing the collision that killed the 40-year-old behind the wheel in the Tesla.Earlier this year, California regulators approved the testing of self-driving cars on public roads without human drivers monitoring inside.“The technology is not ready for it yet, and this just sadly proves it,” said Simpson.In one recent incident, California police officers found a Tesla that was stopped in the middle of a five-lane highway and found a driver asleep behind the wheel. The man said the vehicle was in “autopilot”, which is Tesla’s semi-autonomous driver assist system, and he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.In another recent case, a Tesla car rear-ended a fire truck on a freeway, with the driver again telling the authorities the car was in autopilot mode at the time of the collision.Michael G Bennett, an Arizona State University associate research professor who studies autonomous cars, said the self-driving vehicles have become ubiquitous around campus and on the streets in Tempe. Often they have operators behind the wheels, but sometimes they are fully autonomous with no human inside.The fatal collision could spark significant calls for reform and reflections within the industry, he said.“It may be problematic for the industry, because one of their central arguments for the value of the technology is that it is superior to human drivers,” said Bennett, adding that autonomous cars should be able to detect pedestrians and avoid hitting them, even if they aren’t in crosswalks: “Every day, pedestrians in cities around the world step outside of the crosswalk.”Th e governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has been a strong proponent of allowing corporations to test the technology in his state, publicly slamming other governments for “over regulation” and in 2016 urging Uber to “ditch California” and launch in his region. In March, he issued new rules and said that more than 600 automated vehicles have driven on public roads in the state.“Our prayers are with the victim, and our hearts go out to her family,” Patrick Ptak, Ducey’s spokesman, said in an email to the Guardian, adding, “Public safety is our top priority.”Linda Bailey, the executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (Nacto), said in an interview that there has not been enough regulatory oversight of testing and that some governments are overwhelmed trying to understand autonomous technology and its limitations.“There’s an essential role for the public sector in regulating the safety of these vehicles, which has been largely left to private companies,” she said, adding that Nacto supports third-party testing of the vehicles.Tempe’s mayor, Mark Mitchell, defended the city’s ongoing support of autonomous vehicles in a statement Monday, saying: “All indications we had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here.”",California Bennett Guardian Volvo Ronald Elcock John Phoenix Consumer Watchdog Patrick Ptak Tesla Motors Dara Khosrowshahi Michael Uber Rafael Vasquez Pittsburgh City Transportation Toronto Doug Ducey Simpson Arizona Earlier Linda Bailey National Association Association City Elaine Herzberg Mark Mitchell Public San Francisco State University Nacto

According to the police, the self-driving car had been traveling in the city of Tempe, Arizona, where it had collided with a pedestrian. The 49-year-old succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. Behind the wheel of the Volvo XC90 Uber vehicle another person had been found, but the car was completely in self-drive mode, according to the police. Uber cooperates with the investigators to reconstruct the closer course. A spokeswoman for the Sino-Swedish company said autonomous driving technology is not Volvo's. The NHTSA and the NTSB Accident Investigation Bureau announced that they would send their own teams to Tempe. Company boss Dara Khosrowshahi told Twitter of ""incredibly sad news."" The San Francisco transport service broker said that all tests with self-driving cars in North America would be suspended. According to media reports, the company also wants to deduct its self-driving vehicles from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and the Canadian Toronto.Uber tests including in Arizona self-driving cars and trucks. It is one of several dozen American U companies, including Google's subsidiary Waymo, which tests driverless driving on shared routes. Our robotic car program was burdened with problems right from the start. On the very first day of testing in San Francisco, a Uber car was filmed driving a red traffic light and over a year ago Waymo complained that Uber used stolen robotic car technology. The lawsuit was settled recently, but weighed down the Uber program. It's not the first fatal accident involving a self-drive car. Already in 2016 an accident with a Tesla had occurred. The driver of a Tesla sports car had been in Florida and had used the self-drive mode of the vehicle. In a collision at a crossroads with a truck, the driver had died. The man apparently had his hands off the wheel at the time, though Tesla had warned that their vehicles were not yet able to fully take control of the car. Vehicles like the converted Uber cars, on the other hand, are meant to work without human involvement to drive, even if at present the security drivers often intervene. California recently also allowed the operation of robotic cars with steering wheel and pedals that are controlled solely by computer or radio. Proponents of robotic cars argue that about 90 percent of traffic accidents were due to human error and technology autonomous vehicles will prevent them in the future. However, the industry also assumes that there will be fatal accidents with self-driving cars.

Officials did not make clear whether the accident had happened on Sunday night or Monday morning.The woman died in hospital and has not been named.A spokesman for Uber Technologies Inc said the company was suspending its North American tests. The company had been testing its autonomous cars in Phoenix and Tempe in Arizona, as well as a range of other cities including Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto, all of which have now been suspended.In a tweet, Uber expressed its condolences and said the company was fully cooperating with authorities. Police confirmed that Uber was helping with the investigation.“Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,” wrote Uber chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi in a separate tweet. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with loca l law enforcement to understand what happened.”People have died in crashes involving vehicles that are driving themselves before. But this is thought to be the first time that a pedestrian has died after being hit by a self-driving vehicle.Uber’s autonomous taxis, like the self-driving cars made by other companies, use a series of sensors built into the the car to spot pedestrians, cyclists and other cars, feeding that into a computer that is able to steer and accelerate. Until recently, they have required a real person to be sat in the front of the car and ready to take over – but recently California officials approved the testing of such vehicles without humans in the front seats.Uber started trialling autonomous taxis in 2016, though they have always had human drivers sat in their front seat. The company has suggested that it sees such self-driving cars as the future of its business, potentially allowing it to have cars operate themselves rather than pay people to drive taxis.The company was forced to take the cars off the road temporarily almost a year ago, when another crash in Arizona involving the self-driving vehicles led to a major investigation. The car didn’t kill anyone in that crash but had collided with another road vehicle.The cars have also been involved in smaller issues, such as running red lights.The Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

The accident took place at Curry Road and Mill Avenue.The pedestrian, identified by police as Elaine Herzberg, 49, was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead from her injuries.Police said Herzberg was walking a bicycle across the street outside the crosswalk when she was struck.Cameras on the SUV captured video footage of the accident from both inside and outside the vehicle, Tempe Police Sgt. Ronald Elcock told reporters during a press conference Monday night.""It will definitely assist in our investigation,"" he said.The driver, who was not controlling the vehicle at the time of the accident, was identified as Rafael Vasquez, 44.Hours after the crash, Uber announced the suspension of all tests of its autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto.""Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted. ""We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.""A Twitter account for Uber's communications departme nt said the ride-sharing company is cooperating with Tempe police.Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell released a statement saying that the city will investigate the accident.""The City of Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer in many areas, including transportation options for disabled residents and seniors,"" Mitchell said in the statement. ""Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.”Self-driving cars have been hailed by technology companies as the wave of the future. Autonomous cars are already being tested in more than 30 cities around the world, with companies plowing more than $80 billion into research and development.Self-driving cars work by using complex radar systems to observe the road, objects and other cars. That data is then fed into a computer that decides what the car should do next. Proponents of the technology have claimed that self-driving cars will make transportation safer.""Everyone recognized that someone was going to die in a crash involving an autonomous vehicle eventually,"" Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies risks in automated driving systems, told NBC News.""As good as that technology tries to be, mistakes can happen , or it may be one of the small fraction of crashes that cannot overcome the laws of physics and be avoided.""I just think everybody kind of hoped that one wouldn’t come this soon.""Smith added that because federal and state agencies don't have the resources to monitor individual vehicles, the onus for safety falls on the individual companies running the technology.Self-driving cars have been involved in accidents before, including in Tempe.

There was a vehicle operator inside the car at the time of the crash.Uber said in a statement on Twitter: “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.” A spokesman declined to comment further on the crash.The company said it was pausing its self-driving car operations in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s CEO, tweeted: “Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona. We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.”Uber has been testing its self-driving cars in numerous states and temporarily suspended its vehicles in Arizona last year after a crash involving one of its vehicles, a Volvo SUV. When the company first began testing its self-driving cars in California in 2016, the vehicles were caught running red lights, leading to a high-profile dispute between state regulators and the San Francisco-based corporation.Police identified the victim as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg and said she was walking outside of the crosswalk with a bicycle when she was hit at around 10pm on Sunday. Images from the scene showed a damaged bike. The 2017 Volvo SUV was traveling at roughly 40 miles an hour, and it did not appear that the car slowed down as it approached the woman, said Tempe sergeant Ronald Elcock.Elcock said he had watched footage of the collision, which has not been released to the public. He also identified the operator of the car as Rafael Vasquez, 44, and said he was cooperative and there were no signs of impairment.The self-driving technology is supposed to detect pedestrians, cyclists and others and prevent crashes.John M Simpson, privacy and technology project director with Consumer Watchdog, said the collision highlighted the need for tighter regulations of the nascent technology.“The robot cars cannot accurately predict human behavior, and the real problem comes in the interaction between humans and the robot vehicles,” said Simpson, whose advocacy group called for a national moratorium on autonomous car testing in the wake of the deadly collision.Simpson said he was unaware of any previous fatal crashes involving an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian.Tesla Motors was the first to disclose a death involving a self-driving car in 2016 when the sensors of a Model S driving in autopilot mode failed to detect a large white 18-wheel truck and trailer crossing the highway. The car drove full speed under the trailer, causing the collision that killed the 40-year-old behind the wheel in the Tesla.Earlier this year, California regulators approved the testing of self-driving cars on public roads without human drivers monitoring inside.“The technology is not ready for it yet, and this just sadly proves it,” said Simpson.In one recent incident, California police officers found a Tesla that was stopped in the middle of a five-lane highway and found a driver asleep behind the wheel. The man said the vehicle was in “autopilot”, which is Tesla’s semi-autonomous driver assist system, and he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.In another recent case, a Tesla car rear-ended a fire truck on a freeway, with the driver again telling the authorities the car was in autopilot mode at the time of the collision.Michael G Bennett, an Arizona State University associate research professor who studies autonomous cars, said the self-driving vehicles have become ubiquitous around campus and on the streets in Tempe. Often they have operators behind the wheels, but sometimes they are fully autonomous with no human inside.The fatal collision could spark significant calls for reform and reflections within the industry, he said.“It may be problematic for the industry, because one of their central arguments for the value of the technology is that it is superior to human drivers,” said Bennett, adding that autonomous cars should be able to detect pedestrians and avoid hitting them, even if they aren’t in crosswalks: “Every day, pedestrians in cities around the world step outside of the crosswalk.”Th e governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has been a strong proponent of allowing corporations to test the technology in his state, publicly slamming other governments for “over regulation” and in 2016 urging Uber to “ditch California” and launch in his region. In March, he issued new rules and said that more than 600 automated vehicles have driven on public roads in the state.“Our prayers are with the victim, and our hearts go out to her family,” Patrick Ptak, Ducey’s spokesman, said in an email to the Guardian, adding, “Public safety is our top priority.”Linda Bailey, the executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (Nacto), said in an interview that there has not been enough regulatory oversight of testing and that some governments are overwhelmed trying to understand autonomous technology and its limitations.“There’s an essential role for the public sector in regulating the safety of these vehicles, which has been largely left to private companies,” she said, adding that Nacto supports third-party testing of the vehicles.Tempe’s mayor, Mark Mitchell, defended the city’s ongoing support of autonomous vehicles in a statement Monday, saying: “All indications we had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here.”",California Bennett Guardian Volvo Ronald Elcock John Phoenix Consumer Watchdog Patrick Ptak Tesla Motors Dara Khosrowshahi Michael Uber Rafael Vasquez Pittsburgh City Transportation Toronto Doug Ducey Simpson Arizona Earlier Linda Bailey National Association Association City Elaine Herzberg Mark Mitchell Public San Francisco State University Nacto

The accident is the first time a pedestrian has been killed on a public road by an autonomous car, which has been praised as the safer alternative to a traditional car.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company is aware of the incident and is 'fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation'. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi offered his condolences to the victim's family on Twitter on Monday afternoon, and reiterated that the company will be working with local law enforcement to figure out what happened.The ride-share service has since paused its self-driving car operations in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto.Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell released a statement on Twitter on Monday afternon in support of the halt.   He wrote: 'The City of Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer in many areas, including transportation options for disabled res idents. 'Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here.

That is a responsible step to take at this time' This is not the first time Uber has grounded its fleet of self-driving cars. In March 2017, an autonomous Volvo SUV got into accident when the other vehicle 'failed to yield' while making a left turn, according to police. 'The vehicles collided causing the autonomous vehicle to roll onto its side. There were no serious injuries,' Tempe police spokeswoman Josie Montenegros said at the time. The only known death involving a self-driving car and a driver was when Tesla driver Joshua Brown was killed in 2016 while operating the company's Autopilot software.However, this crash occurred only after Brown ignored repeated warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel. Tesla has stated that Autopilot is a driver assistance feature, not a replacement for a human driver.The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday that it will be sending teams to Tempe to investigate the accident.In a statement, the NHTSA said it is 'in contact with Uber, Volvo, federal, state and loc al authorities regarding the incident' and will take appropriate action. Meanwhile, other states are already taking action.

California Volvo Arizona Phoenix San Francisco Pittsburgh Toronto,"Germany | Fußgängerin stirbt nach Unfall mit autonomem Uber-Auto | https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/uber-165.html |  Self-driving cars should make traffic safer. But the technology is far from mature. In the US state of Arizona, an autonomous Uber car now hit a pedestrian. She died. The car had been sent to the street by the trucking agent Uber. According to the police, the self-driving car had been traveling in the city of Tempe, Arizona, where it had collided with a pedestrian. The 49-year-old succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. Behind the wheel of the Volvo XC90 Uber vehicle another person had been found, but the car was completely in self-drive mode, according to the police. Uber cooperates with the investigators to reconstruct the closer course. A spokeswoman for the Sino-Swedish company said autonomous driving technology is not Volvo's. The NHTSA and the NTSB Accident Investigation Bureau announced that they would send their own teams to Tempe. Company boss Dara Khosrowshahi told Twitter of ""incredibly sad news."" The San Francisco transport service broker said that all tests with self-driving cars in North America would be suspended. According to media reports, the company also wants to deduct its self-driving vehicles from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and the Canadian Toronto.Uber tests including in Arizona self-driving cars and trucks. It is one of several dozen American U companies, including Google's subsidiary Waymo, which tests driverless driving on shared routes. Our robotic car program was burdened with problems right from the start. On the very first day of testing in San Francisco, a Uber car was filmed driving a red traffic light and over a year ago Waymo complained that Uber used stolen robotic car technology. The lawsuit was settled recently, but weighed down the Uber program. It's not the first fatal accident involving a self-drive car. Already in 2016 an accident with a Tesla had occurred. The driver of a Tesla sports car had been in Florida and had used the self-drive mode of the vehicle. In a collision at a crossroads with a truck, the driver had died. The man apparently had his hands off the wheel at the time, though Tesla had warned that their vehicles were not yet able to fully take control of the car. Vehicles like the converted Uber cars, on the other hand, are meant to work without human involvement to drive, even if at present the security drivers often intervene. California recently also allowed the operation of robotic cars with steering wheel and pedals that are controlled solely by computer or radio. Proponents of robotic cars argue that about 90 percent of traffic accidents were due to human error and technology autonomous vehicles will prevent them in the future. However, the industry also assumes that there will be fatal accidents with self-driving cars.

There was a vehicle operator inside the car at the time of the crash.Uber said in a statement on Twitter: “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.” A spokesman declined to comment further on the crash.The company said it was pausing its self-driving car operations in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s CEO, tweeted: “Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona. We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.”Uber has been testing its self-driving cars in numerous states and temporarily suspended its vehicles in Arizona last year after a crash involving one of its vehicles, a Volvo SUV. When the company first began testing its self-driving cars in California in 2016, the vehicles were caught running red lights, leading to a high-profile dispute between state regulators and the San Francisco-based corporation.Police identified the victim as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg and said she was walking outside of the crosswalk with a bicycle when she was hit at around 10pm on Sunday. Images from the scene showed a damaged bike. The 2017 Volvo SUV was traveling at roughly 40 miles an hour, and it did not appear that the car slowed down as it approached the woman, said Tempe sergeant Ronald Elcock.Elcock said he had watched footage of the collision, which has not been released to the public. He also identified the operator of the car as Rafael Vasquez, 44, and said he was cooperative and there were no signs of impairment.The self-driving technology is supposed to detect pedestrians, cyclists and others and prevent crashes.John M Simpson, privacy and technology project director with Consumer Watchdog, said the collision highlighted the need for tighter regulations of the nascent technology.“The robot cars cannot accurately predict human behavior, and the real problem comes in the interaction between humans and the robot vehicles,” said Simpson, whose advocacy group called for a national moratorium on autonomous car testing in the wake of the deadly collision.Simpson said he was unaware of any previous fatal crashes involving an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian.Tesla Motors was the first to disclose a death involving a self-driving car in 2016 when the sensors of a Model S driving in autopilot mode failed to detect a large white 18-wheel truck and trailer crossing the highway. The car drove full speed under the trailer, causing the collision that killed the 40-year-old behind the wheel in the Tesla.Earlier this year, California regulators approved the testing of self-driving cars on public roads without human drivers monitoring inside.“The technology is not ready for it yet, and this just sadly proves it,” said Simpson.In one recent incident, California police officers found a Tesla that was stopped in the middle of a five-lane highway and found a driver asleep behind the wheel. The man said the vehicle was in “autopilot”, which is Tesla’s semi-autonomous driver assist system, and he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.In another recent case, a Tesla car rear-ended a fire truck on a freeway, with the driver again telling the authorities the car was in autopilot mode at the time of the collision.Michael G Bennett, an Arizona State University associate research professor who studies autonomous cars, said the self-driving vehicles have become ubiquitous around campus and on the streets in Tempe. Often they have operators behind the wheels, but sometimes they are fully autonomous with no human inside.The fatal collision could spark significant calls for reform and reflections within the industry, he said.“It may be problematic for the industry, because one of their central arguments for the value of the technology is that it is superior to human drivers,” said Bennett, adding that autonomous cars should be able to detect pedestrians and avoid hitting them, even if they aren’t in crosswalks: “Every day, pedestrians in cities around the world step outside of the crosswalk.”Th e governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has been a strong proponent of allowing corporations to test the technology in his state, publicly slamming other governments for “over regulation” and in 2016 urging Uber to “ditch California” and launch in his region. In March, he issued new rules and said that more than 600 automated vehicles have driven on public roads in the state.“Our prayers are with the victim, and our hearts go out to her family,” Patrick Ptak, Ducey’s spokesman, said in an email to the Guardian, adding, “Public safety is our top priority.”Linda Bailey, the executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (Nacto), said in an interview that there has not been enough regulatory oversight of testing and that some governments are overwhelmed trying to understand autonomous technology and its limitations.“There’s an essential role for the public sector in regulating the safety of these vehicles, which has been largely left to private companies,” she said, adding that Nacto supports third-party testing of the vehicles.Tempe’s mayor, Mark Mitchell, defended the city’s ongoing support of autonomous vehicles in a statement Monday, saying: “All indications we had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here.”",California Bennett Guardian Volvo Ronald Elcock John Phoenix Consumer Watchdog Patrick Ptak Tesla Motors Dara Khosrowshahi Michael Uber Rafael Vasquez Pittsburgh City Transportation Toronto Doug Ducey Simpson Arizona Earlier Linda Bailey National Association Association City Elaine Herzberg Mark Mitchell Public San Francisco State University Nacto

RUSSIA Vladimir Putin MALAYSIA MH17 Dutch Boeing,"Russia | Воскрешение справедливости | https://russian.rt.com/opinion/493917-petrovskiy-voskreshenie-spravedlivosti |  At Alexanderplatz, the central square of East Berlin, ""under the clock"" (the main meeting place, something like ""near the Lenin monument"" in the Russian provincial city), yesterday a small company of compatriots gathered. I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

The West believes Russia was responsible for the tragedy.Voloshin, 29, was a Su-25 pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force when the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky on July 17, 2014, leading to 298 deaths.Reports in Ukraine say he was found dead at his home in Mykolayiv from a gunshot wound. A murder probe has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities although initial reports suggest he took his own life.Work colleagues reported that he had been feeling 'depressed'. His wife said she heard a gun shot and ran to him. Reports say she called police and ambulance, but a team of paramedics was unable to save his life.After the Russian accusations originally made in December 2014 , Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force and since last year was acting director of Mykolayiv International Airport.A BBC documentary in 2016 highlighted the claims which directly conflict with the official Dutch-led probe into the air horror which insists MH17 was downed by a powerful surface-to-air Buk missile shot from pro-Russian rebel held territory.Voloshin said last year: 'I did not shoot down the MH17 Boeing. A former military mate of mine called (Evgeny) Agapov, a mechanical engineer, falsely gave evidence against me.'He stressed: 'We did not carry out flights on July 17.

But again this actually happened on the 23rd.'He said that the aircraft was carrying air-to-air missiles. There were no air-to-air missiles. I was carrying air-to-surface weapons for ground targets.'Russia had claimed Agapov was a credible witness from Dnipropetrovsk air base, where both men served.Agapov alleged the Ukrainian captain went on a sortie armed with air-to-air missiles, and returned without them soon after the Boeing 777 was downed.After landing, Voloshin was 'scared', muttering that the incoming 'aircraft' - supposedly MH17 - 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time', he claimed.The Russian Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, insisted that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony was credible.SBU official Markiyan Lubkivskyi countered that Voloshin was not engaged in combat flights on July 17, the day MH17 was downed, and had not used weapons against aerial targets in the current conflict.Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17.He said: 'A great deal of evidence, including data from satellite observation, has proved that terrorist groups controlled by the Russian military shot down the passenger aircraft'.They us ed 'a Russian BUK surface-to-air-missile system', he said.But Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said: 'The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly and without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed.'He 'personally' saw Voloshin's warplane 'loaded with R-60 type air-to-air missiles, with which Su-25 fighters were not normally equipped'.His aircraft returned without these missiles.Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force in 2016 claiming that he could not afford to raise his two children on his service pay.Reports since his death said that he had admitted to feeling 'suicidal'.Police said it was normal to launch a murder probe in such circumstances.",Markiyan Lubkivskyi SBU MH17 Airlines Air Force International Airport Alexander Bastrykin Evgeny Agapov RUSSIA Vladimir Putin MALAYSIA Dutch Mykolayiv Boeing Voloshin National Markin UKRAINE
Miranda Hobbes Sex City Trump Blasio Cynthia Nixon,"United States | Cynthia Nixon Announces Bid to Run for New York Governor | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/nyregion/cynthia-nixon-new-york-governor-cuomo.html |  The actress Cynthia Nixon officially jumped into the race for governor of New York on Monday, setting off what promises to be a tumultuous six months as she challenges Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in this year’s Democratic primary.Ms. Nixon, 51, has never before run for elected office and has chosen a huge undertaking for her first bid: seeking to unseat a two-term incumbent (and son of a three-term governor) who is sitting atop more than $30 million in campaign cash.The contest will likely become one of the marquee Democratic primaries in the nation, as Ms. Nixon is widely expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the political left. Her campaign immediately cast Mr. Cuomo as a “centrist and Albany insider,” and some of her initial rhetoric on inequality echoed Senator Bernie Sanders.“We are now the most unequal state in the entire country, with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty,” she said in a video posted on Twitter announcing her candidacy.Splashed across the top of her website are more hints of her campaign’s coming focus. One of the five categories — along with “Meet Cynthia” and “Donate” — is a hashtag: #CuomosMTA, a term used often by critics of the governor for New York’s faltering subway system run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Scenes of her riding the subways are also spliced in her opening ad.Ms. Nixon, best known for her work in the “Sex and the City” franchise, is expected to lean heavily on her star power and ability to draw media attention in ways that most traditional challengers could not.Within 18 minutes of posting her announcement video on Monday, she was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter in New York, and then nationwide 20 minutes after that. Her video topped 1 million views on Twitter alone by the evening.But her campaign may test the appetite of New Yorkers for a celebrity leader in the age of President Trump, a deeply unpopular figure here among Democrats. While Ms. Nixon has been an education activist for many years her fame could cut both ways in the coming months.Mr. Cuomo has downplayed the challenge in recent days, even as his political operation has busily sought to burnish his progressive credentials.“I’m not nervous about whoever runs,” Mr. Cuomo said last week. “There’ll be people who run. That’s called elections, and that’s fine.”If elected, Ms. Nixon would become the first female governor, and the first openly gay governor, in New York history.“Our leaders are letting us down,” she said in the announcement video.“Something has to change,” she said in the ad. “We want our government to work again, on health care, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway. We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us. It can’t just be business as usual anymore.”The language on her website was more aggressive. There, she accused Mr. Cuomo of “inhumane budgets” and of “selling New York off to the highest bidder.”Mr. Cuomo begins the race as a heavy front-runner. A Siena College poll on Monday had him leading Ms. Nixon among registered Democrats 66 percent to 19 percent. But an ugly primary could affect the governor beyond 2018, should he run for president in 2020.Jefrey Pollock, a longtime pollster for Mr. Cuomo, was dismissive of Ms. Nixon, saying that Democratic voters are especially uninterested in celebrity leaders in the current political climate, and prefer candidates who can “counter what they see as the chaos of the inexperienced.”“They are looking for proven experience to take the fight to Donald Trump and to Republicans across the state,” he said.Four years ago, Zephyr Teachout, a virtually unknown law professor, jolted the New York political scene when she scored more than 34 percent of the vote in her run against Mr. Cuomo, who largely ignored her. Ms. Teachout has signed on as Ms. Nixon’s campaign treasurer.Mr. Cuomo has remained a polarizing figure, particularly among Democratic activists, even as he has increasingly shifted leftward in recent years, enacting a minimum-wage increase, paid family leave and free college tuition scholarships for middle-class families.A powerful figure known for his long memory, Mr. Cuomo is expected to consolidate much of the institutional support across the state, from labor unions to business leaders to major donors. (Last week, before Ms. Nixon officially entered the contest, the New York arm of the National Organization for Women endorsed the governor.)For Ms. Nixon, that likely means sh e must run an insurgent campaign, and early indications are she will focus on digital organizing. She has tapped as campaign manager Nicole Aro, a former digital strategist for the AFL-CIO.Tim Tagaris, who served as digital fund-raising director for Mr. Sanders’ presidential campaign, has also signed on to help Ms. Nixon, according to two people familiar with the situation.In addition, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, two former strategists for Mayor Bill de Blasio, have been advising Ms. Nixon’s campaign.Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have sparred for years, and the mayor is close to Ms. Nixon, who aggressively endorsed his initial candidacy in 2013. Ms. Nixon’s wife, Christine Marinoni, recently stepped down from a post in the de Blasio administration.Mr. Cuomo has yet to build out his campaign team, despite his sizable treasury. His campaign manager from his 2010 and 2014 races, Joseph Percoco, was convicted on bribery charges last week in a federal trial.Still, he has vast resources at his fingertips. Last week, the state Democratic Party bought $100,000 in television ads touting Mr. Cuomo’s efforts on gun control. The party later said Mr. Cuomo’s campaign covered the cost.Born and raised in New York, Ms. Nixon attended Hunter College High School and Barnard College while breaking into acting. She is best known for playing Miranda Hobbes on “Sex and the City,” a world-weary lawyer navigating life in late-1990s and early-2000s New York. In a plot twist that now seems quaint, Mira nda horrified her friends by moving from a Manhattan apartment to a brownstone in Brooklyn.Now she’ll be stumping for votes in both boroughs.Ms. Nixon mostly narrates her opening two-minute video, but as she rides a train in the final moments, the conductor can be heard overhead: “Next stop is Albany.”",Scenes CuomosMTA City Christine Marinoni Party Ms Brooklyn AFL Donald Splashed Cynthia Nixon Hunter Miranda Hobbes Sex Barnard High School Metropolitan Transportation Trump Transportation Authority Blasio Albany Joseph Percoco Siena College Nicole Aro Jefrey Pollock New York Zephyr Teachout Manhattan,"United Kingdom | Cynthia Nixon announces she is running for Governor of New York | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5519655/Cynthia-Nixon-announces-running-Governor-New-York.html |  Native New Yorker and Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon has announced her candidacy for Governor of the the Empire State, in a direct challenge to incumbent Andrew Cuomo.Nixon announced her debut in the world of politics with a two-minute video on her social media platforms, where she declared: 'I love New York and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor.' She also began to lay out what her platform will be as she prepares to face ogg against the sitting governor.'We want our government to work again. On health care, ending massive incarceration, fixing our broken subway,' said Nixon.'We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us.' Scroll down for videoEarlier this month,  NY 1 broke the news that Nixon would challenge Governor Cuomo in the Democratic primary later this year. It was also revealed that two key members behind Bill de Blasio's successful run for mayor of New York City back in 2014 will play crucial roles in Nixon's campaign.This news is not all that shocking in the wake of a piece that Nixon posted on CNN back in January ahead of President Trump's first State of the Union address.She has also been a very dedicated anbd loyal surrogate for a number of politicians, particularly Mayor de Blasio and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  In that CNN piece, Nixon wrote that just voting is not enough any more, and that a more involved role in government among those underrepresented communities was the only way t o 'take back our government.''Given the current state of the union, taking our country back is going to require all of us everyday people to step up and take action - whether by protesting anti-immigrant policies, organizing for women's rights, refusing to give polluters our business, demonstrating against police violence, or even taking the leap to run for office ourselves,' stated Nixon. 'Everyday people running means more people of color, more women, more queer people, more first-generation Americans, more allies -- more of the people whose voices have been missing for far too long.'She then added: 'We may not have million dollar super PACs behind us, but we'll have something more important - a shared mission uniting millions of people across this nation.'Nixon also hinted at the idea of a run back in August during an interview on Today.'I think there are a lot of people who would like me to run,' said Nixon. 'I think for a variety of reasons but the one number is education.'The state of New York currently ranks close to last when it comes to equitable funding among public schools, which is something that Nixon has worked to change for years.'Governor Cuomo likes to say that we spend more per pupil than any other state, and that is actually true. But the only reason that is true is because we spend so much on the kids in our wealthiest districts,' Nixon explained on that Today appearance.'Between our hundred richest schools and our hundred poorest schools there’s a $10,000 gap on what we spend per pupil.'Host Al Roker tried to get her to admit she might be eyeing a run during that segment, but Nixon refused to comment, saying:"" 'I cannot.'Nixon has been working as an actress her entire life, but shot to international fame thanks to her role as Miranda Hobbes on Sex and the City.Of the four actresses who starred on the program, it is Nixon who has enjoyed the most critical success ever since the program went off the air.She picked up an Emmy for the show's final season and another four years later for her guest turn on the popular NBC series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Nixon has also won a Best Actress Tony for her work in Rabbit Hole in 2007 and a second in the Best Supporting Actress category just last year for The Little Foxes. And in 2009 Nixon even scored a Grammy in the Best Spoken Word Album category along with Beau Bridges and her former Sex and the City paramour Blair Underwood for their reading of on An Inconvenient Truth.That puts her just one award away from becoming an EGOT, which is the quadruple crown of the entertainment industry.",Rabbit Hole City York Grammy Beau Bridges CNN Andrew Cuomo Clinton ALBANIA Host Spoken Word Actress Tony Cynthia Nixon Miranda Hobbes Sex Scroll Trump EGOT Blasio New Yorker PACs Roker Native New Blair Word Album State Best Actress

The Brooklyn, New York resident will run against current governor and fellow Democrat Andrew Cuomo. Ms Nixon tweeted: ""I love New York, and today I am announcing my candidacy for governor,"" accompanied by a video. Ms Nixon has said she is a ""progressive activist who is running for governor to fight for a better, more equal New York"". In the video she noted that she has ""never lived anywhere else,"" growing up in the city as the child of a single mother in a one-bedroom flat who had initially become an actress as a means of supporting herself while attending university at Barnard College in New York. “I just think we need to have more people of color and women and LGBT people not just represented — but leading...If we want to fix our world, they know what’s wrong with it because they’ve been on the short end of the stick,"" Ms Nixon had told People magazine when rumours had begun swirling about her bid. Since the massively popular series ended, she has become known for her activism in LGBTQ rights, public education advocacy, and reproductive rights. She will be the first openly gay candidate for the state's governor, married to prominent LGBTQ activist Christine Marinoni who until recently worked directly with New York City's Deputy Mayor Richard Buery. It may bode well for the 51-year-old mother of three to have close ties to Mayor Bill de B lasio, who has butted heads frequently with Mr Cuomo on a number of issues between the city and the state, most recently the state of much-needed repairs to the subway system. She had accused Mr Cuomo in the past of being the reason for inequality between the states's ""richest"" and ""poorest"" schools as well as ""shortchanging the children of New York State,"" in an appearance on the talk show The View.Ms Nixon faces a tough fight against the two-time incumbent and Mr Cuomo's $30m campaign fund after issuing a statement on her campaign website indicating she would not ""be accepting any corporate contributions in this campaign"". She also may not be able to bank on the show's immense popularity for her own as a politician. A new poll released by Siena College had Mr Cuomo up 66 per cent to Ms Nixon's 19 per cent with New York Democrats. The actress and social activist also faced a 20 per cent favourable to 19 per cent unfavourable rating among all New Yorkers in the same poll - with the overwhelming majority of 60 per cent having no opinion at all. She also saw a similar unfavourable rating with Democrats in the Empire state. ""While Nixon does a little better among younger and upstate Democrats, she doesn't have the support of more than one-quarter of either group,"" pollster Steven Greenberg told New York Daily News. The one saving grace may be that poll numbers showed New Yorkers' split views on a third-term by Mr Cuomo, a political legacy in the state after his father Mario was a three-term Governor as well. Forty-eight per cent said they could vote for him while and 46 per cent said they preferred fresh blood in the state capital of Albany.",LGBTQ City Christine Marinoni Yorkers Brooklyn Barnard College Siena Richard Buery Daily News Mario Cynthia Nixon LGBT Miranda Hobbes New York State Steven Greenberg
Channel Mark Turnbull UNITED KINGDOM Alexander Nix Cambridge Analytica News,"United States | Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html |  WASHINGTON — Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee.

He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation.“Oh, we do a lot more than that,” he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded.“You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.”Nix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. “I’m a master of disguise,” Turnbull said.Another option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he told the reporter. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.”He said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying, because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.”Any work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups.“We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the source in a first phone call.Cambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying.“It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’”He added: “It may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.”In a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but “no one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out”, Turnbull said.Covers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections – apparently employed in violation of Federal law.Nix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. “We have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.”Denham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been “unco-operative” with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. “We need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,” she said.Cambridge Analytica said the Channel 4 News investigation contained false claims, factual inaccuracies and substantial mischaracterisations.It accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment.It said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”Of the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: “Our executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.”In a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use.Admitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: “In playing along with this line of conversation … we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks … I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.”On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica denied it had done anything wrong in relation to the handling of Facebook data.“Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations,” it said.",ISRAEL Guardian Deep Mark Turnbull Channel UNITED KINGDOM Covers News Alexander Nix Cambridge Analytica Denham
RUSSIA Stroz Friedberg UNITED STATES Damian Collins UNITED KINGDOM Cambridge Analytica,"United States | Cambridge Analytica, Trump-Tied Political Firm, Offered to Entrap Politicians | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html |  WASHINGTON — Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.",IDs Channel Stephen Mark Turnbull Bannon Africa SCL Group UNITED STATES Zuckerberg York Times Alexander Nix Robert Mercer Cambridge Analytica House Commons News Stroz Friedberg Caribbean Berkeley Damian Collins RUSSIA Trump Observer Elections UNITED KINGDOM Parliament Elizabeth Denham New York Republican,"United Kingdom | Where's Zuck?

Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unl ikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.Referencing the government’s request for Facebook’s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica’s offices, Collins tweeted: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.”The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks.

The accident took place at Curry Road and Mill Avenue.The pedestrian, identified by police as Elaine Herzberg, 49, was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead from her injuries.Police said Herzberg was walking a bicycle across the street outside the crosswalk when she was struck.Cameras on the SUV captured video footage of the accident from both inside and outside the vehicle, Tempe Police Sgt. Ronald Elcock told reporters during a press conference Monday night.""It will definitely assist in our investigation,"" he said.The driver, who was not controlling the vehicle at the time of the accident, was identified as Rafael Vasquez, 44.Hours after the crash, Uber announced the suspension of all tests of its autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto.""Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona,"" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi tweeted. ""We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.""A Twitter account for Uber's communications departme nt said the ride-sharing company is cooperating with Tempe police.Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell released a statement saying that the city will investigate the accident.""The City of Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer in many areas, including transportation options for disabled residents and seniors,"" Mitchell said in the statement. ""Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.”Self-driving cars have been hailed by technology companies as the wave of the future. Autonomous cars are already being tested in more than 30 cities around the world, with companies plowing more than $80 billion into research and development.Self-driving cars work by using complex radar systems to observe the road, objects and other cars. That data is then fed into a computer that decides what the car should do next. Proponents of the technology have claimed that self-driving cars will make transportation safer.""Everyone recognized that someone was going to die in a crash involving an autonomous vehicle eventually,"" Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who studies risks in automated driving systems, told NBC News.""As good as that technology tries to be, mistakes can happen , or it may be one of the small fraction of crashes that cannot overcome the laws of physics and be avoided.""I just think everybody kind of hoped that one wouldn’t come this soon.""Smith added that because federal and state agencies don't have the resources to monitor individual vehicles, the onus for safety falls on the individual companies running the technology.Self-driving cars have been involved in accidents before, including in Tempe.

The accident is the first time a pedestrian has been killed on a public road by an autonomous car, which has been praised as the safer alternative to a traditional car.SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company is aware of the incident and is 'fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation'. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi offered his condolences to the victim's family on Twitter on Monday afternoon, and reiterated that the company will be working with local law enforcement to figure out what happened.The ride-share service has since paused its self-driving car operations in Pittsburgh, Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto.Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell released a statement on Twitter on Monday afternon in support of the halt.   He wrote: 'The City of Tempe has been supportive of autonomous vehicle testing because of the innovation and promise the technology may offer in many areas, including transportation options for disabled res idents. 'Testing must occur safely. All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe Police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward.'I support the step that Uber has take to temporarily suspend testing in Tempe until this event is fully examined and understood. That is a responsible step to take at this time' This is not the first time Uber has grounded its fleet of self-driving cars. In March 2017, an autonomous Volvo SUV got into accident when the other vehicle 'failed to yield' while making a left turn, according to police. 'The vehicles collided causing the autonomous vehicle to roll onto its side. There were no serious injuries,' Tempe police spokeswoman Josie Montenegros said at the time. The only known death involving a self-driving car and a driver was when Tesla driver Joshua Brown was killed in 2016 while operating the company's Autopilot software.However, this crash occurred only after Brown ignored repeated warnings to put his hands back on the steering wheel. Tesla has stated that Autopilot is a driver assistance feature, not a replacement for a human driver.The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said on Monday that it will be sending teams to Tempe to investigate the accident.In a statement, the NHTSA said it is 'in contact with Uber, Volvo, federal, state and loc al authorities regarding the incident' and will take appropriate action. Meanwhile, other states are already taking action. California regulators ordered Uber to stop its newly launched self-driving car service in San Francisco until it gets a state permit.In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, DMV officials wrote that Uber 'must cease' deploying the cars or face unspecified legal action.Uber knew about the permit requirement but argued that its cars do not meet the state's definition of an 'autonomous vehicle' because they require a person behind the wheel to monitor and intervene if needed.  In September, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao released new guidelines that permit more testing of self-driving cars and address regulation between the federal government and states.Chao argued that self-driving technology could also improve mobility for the elderly, disabled and other restricted populations.But the non-profit Consumer Watchdog has warned that roads are being turned 'into private laboratories for robot cars with no regard for our safety.'Not much information has been released about Herzberg. However, she has been arrested six times between October 2014 and October 2015 for a number of drug charges and probation violations.Additionally, according to her Facebook account, she has been married three times and became a mother at age 15 and again at age 18.",NHTSA California Volvo Highway Traffic Phoenix Transportation Tempe Pittsburgh Joshua Brown Toronto Safety Administration Board National Highway Traffic Safety SCROLL Associated Press Elaine Herzberg San Francisco Autopilot Josie Montenegros

The findings were broadcast by the network on Monday.On hidden camera, the reporters recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, ""an offer he can't refuse"" or ""send some girls around to the candidate’s house.""Nix also floated the idea of spreading misinformation about politicians.""It doesn't have to be true,"" Nix said. ""It just has to be believed.""He later discussed creating fake IDs and having people pose as students or tourists as a way to further the political efforts without having its work traced back to clients.Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was also recorded by the ITN Channel 4 News reporters discussing his relationships with former British spies now working at private companies who can be contracted to gather intelligence, along with private Israeli intelligence companies.Long a company of interest in the Tru mp-Russia investigation, Cambridge Analytica came under fresh scrutiny this past weekend after the company's former director of data research, Christopher Wylie, revealed how the company had mined data from at least 50 million Facebook users.Publicly, the company advertises its ability to build ""psychographic"" profiles that can microtarget social media political advertising to people based on traits like ""extroversion"" or ""neuroticism.""The company received a $15 million investment from wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, who also funded the conservative website Breitbart while Steve Bannon — who later became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign — was at the helm.A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied to ITN Channel 4 News that it used any of the tactics discussed in the videos.“We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,"" the spokesperson sent in a statement.“Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose,” the spokesperson added.Bannon met with Nix and was interested in how the profiles could be used to change American politics, Wylie said.""Steve wanted weapons for a culture war. We offered him a way to change the culture of America,"" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. Sources familiar with Cambridge Analytica’s work on the Trump campaign say “psychographics” were not used.A source familiar with the hiring of Cambridge An alytica told NBC News that the primary figures involved in the hiring were Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, who was digital director of the Trump campaign. Parscale has denied that the firm was useful to the campaign and said the Trump campaign instead used data from the Republican National Committee.On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from buying ads or administering pages on its platform on behalf of clients, saying its data policies had been violated.""We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the claims.The developments drew rebuke from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic over the weekend.“Revelations that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired the personal, private information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission or that of Facebook, must be thoroughly investigated,"" Rep.

It can’t just be business as usual anymore.”Describing the governor as a “centrist and insider,’’ Nixon added that Cuomo has “been defined by a string of indictments for corruption,” failed to fix the subways and is in cahoots with the GOP through a “backroom deal” that allows them to control the state Senate.Her celebrity status — Nixon played the sensible Miranda on the hit HBO series — immediately paid off in terms of publicity for her campaign.News of the actress’s first bid for political office dominated the Internet and was trending on Facebook and Twitter.Former “SATC” co-star Kristin Davis, who portrayed conservative Charlotte, added to the star power, tweeting, “I am so proud of @cynthiaNixon . . .

But it’s next to impossible to beat an incumbent governor in the primary,’’ Sheinkopf told The Post.Still, he said, Cuomo will have to careful in the way he criticizes Nixon.“You can’t run a traditional negative campaign against a woman in this ‘Me Too’ moment,” he said.Last week, the governor had called Nixon a second-rate celebrity with no political chops.A Cuomo campaign spokesman said in a statement Monday, “It’s great that we live in a democracy where anyone can run for office.’’Additional reporting by Kate Sheehy",Kate Sheehy George Albro City Christine Marinoni HBO Kristin Davis Post Senate SATC Hank Sheinkopf Cynthia Nixon Sex GOP Cuomo Miranda Bernie Sanders New York NYPAN Zephyr Teachout

And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",UNITED STATES BELGIUM SPAIN Sergei OPCW SLOVAKIA Russ Alexander Litvinenko CZECH REPUBLIC SWEDEN RUSSIA Vladimir Putin Chemical Weapons Convention Salisbury UNITED KINGDOM Federica Mogherini Boris Johnson Kingdom March Alfonso Dastis Novichok Yulia Skripal
RUSSIA UNITED STATES Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg Alex Stamos,"United States | Facebook Security Chief Said to Leave After Clashes Over Disinformation | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html |  As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.The impending exit of that executive — Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief information security officer — reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controv ersy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, accord ing to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook i nitially denied.By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust, ’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”",UNITED STATES Democrat Munich Senator Honest Data Alex Stamos Clinton Pedro Canahuati YouTube DNC Tavis McGinn RUSSIA Sandy Parakilas Elliot Schrage National Committee Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg Humane Technology Capitol Hill Warner Virginia Yahoo San Francisco,"United Kingdom | Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds | https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/19/where-is-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-cambridge-analytica-scandal |  The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices, and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unl ikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.Referencing the government’s request for Facebook’s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica’s offices, Collins tweeted: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.”The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing.",Information Commissioner UNITED STATES John Kennedy Global Science WheresZuck Alex Stamos Science Research Senate Ron Wyden Google Cambridge Analytica Stroz Friedberg RUSSIA Damian Collins UNITED KINGDOM CSO DeleteFacebook CEOs Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg UK

The findings were broadcast by the network on Monday.On hidden camera, the reporters recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, ""an offer he can't refuse"" or ""send some girls around to the candidate’s house.""Nix also floated the idea of spreading misinformation about politicians.""It doesn't have to be true,"" Nix said. ""It just has to be believed.""He later discussed creating fake IDs and having people pose as students or tourists as a way to further the political efforts without having its work traced back to clients.Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was also recorded by the ITN Channel 4 News reporters discussing his relationships with former British spies now working at private companies who can be contracted to gather intelligence, along with private Israeli intelligence companies.Long a company of interest in the Tru mp-Russia investigation, Cambridge Analytica came under fresh scrutiny this past weekend after the company's former director of data research, Christopher Wylie, revealed how the company had mined data from at least 50 million Facebook users.Publicly, the company advertises its ability to build ""psychographic"" profiles that can microtarget social media political advertising to people based on traits like ""extroversion"" or ""neuroticism.""The company received a $15 million investment from wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, who also funded the conservative website Breitbart while Steve Bannon — who later became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign — was at the helm.A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied to ITN Channel 4 News that it used any of the tactics discussed in the videos.“We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,"" the spokesperson sent in a statement.“Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose,” the spokesperson added.Bannon met with Nix and was interested in how the profiles could be used to change American politics, Wylie said.""Steve wanted weapons for a culture war. We offered him a way to change the culture of America,"" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. Sources familiar with Cambridge Analytica’s work on the Trump campaign say “psychographics” were not used.A source familiar with the hiring of Cambridge An alytica told NBC News that the primary figures involved in the hiring were Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, who was digital director of the Trump campaign. Parscale has denied that the firm was useful to the campaign and said the Trump campaign instead used data from the Republican National Committee.On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from buying ads or administering pages on its platform on behalf of clients, saying its data policies had been violated.""We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the claims.The developments drew rebuke from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic over the weekend.“Revelations that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired the personal, private information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission or that of Facebook, must be thoroughly investigated,"" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should appear before the panel to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its customers' data.Those calls were echoed by Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling during Brexit.

He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation.“Oh, we do a lot more than that,” he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded.“You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.”Nix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. “I’m a master of disguise,” Turnbull said.Another option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he told the reporter. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.”He said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying, because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.”Any work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups.“We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the source in a first phone call.Cambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying.“It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’”He added: “It may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.”In a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but “no one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out”, Turnbull said.Covers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections – apparently employed in violation of Federal law.Nix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. “We have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.”Denham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been “unco-operative” with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. “We need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,” she said.Cambridge Analytica said the Channel 4 News investigation contained false claims, factual inaccuracies and substantial mischaracterisations.It accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment.It said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”Of the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: “Our executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.”In a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use.Admitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: “In playing along with this line of conversation … we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks … I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.”On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica denied it had done anything wrong in relation to the handling of Facebook data.“Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations,” it said.",ISRAEL Guardian Deep Mark Turnbull Channel UNITED KINGDOM Covers News Alexander Nix Cambridge Analytica Denham

This is a motto that has so far not been associated with Angela Merkel's style of politics. Nevertheless, the fourth cabinet of the Chancellor takes up his work with unfamiliar roughness. Islam, poverty, abortion - the new government was barely in office and immediately ignited a firework of right-wing blast. Or is this a sign of Merkel's loss of control? Or the expression of a general mood, which - in a modification of a famous presidential statement - has the one demand: through Germany, a shift to the right! Horst Seehofer and Jens Spahn have in the Cabinet Merkel IV the role of conservative bang batches. Within a few days, one has expatriated Islam from Germany and the other only insulted Hartz IV recipients as crybabies and then compensated for abortions against animal welfare. Politics of the center is different. But who says that this government will make a policy of the middle? It is part of the essence of the Union to represent mostly the so-called healthy sense of the people. And right now, that's right. On the internet, you can read a ""2018 statement,"" which reads: ""We are watching with increasing consternation how Germany is damaged by illegal mass immigration, and we are solidarizing ourselves with those who peacefully demonstrate for it that the rule of law is restored at the borders of our country. "" These people talk about the law aat - in truth, they want the Rechtsruck.Vornweg run the usual suspects - Sarrazin, Broder, Lengsfeld -, followed by a lot of AfD sympathizers and other brown socks. And then there are all the angry professors and doctorses, the sour creme de la creme of the worried German bourgeoisie. They can not assert any extenuating circumstances for themselves - heavy Eastern childhood, fear of globalization or something - they know exactly what they are doing: they want pure Germany. And Horst Seehofer also knows what he does when he gives sugar to such people. ""Islam does not belong to Germany"" - the sentence was deliberately unclear because its meaning is completely different, depending on whether one understands it normatively or descriptively. Seehofer knows that, of course. But he does not care. In Bavaria is campaigning, Markus Söder had his first day in the State Chancellery - two good reasons to let out the Horst. And when it comes to Muslims, applies not only in Munich, the old sentence of Monaco Franze: A little bit what is always. But not the Muslims are the problem, but the potato Germans. Unfortunately, quite a few are grumpy, anxious, spoiled and haughty - and the dull-cheeked populism comes along, the greater is his chance of success with these people. Horst Seehofer's zenith as a populist is already behind him - but Jens Spahn still has his own. His comments on Hartz IV - is not poverty, one comes super with clear - could perhaps still be recorded as a typical cold-blooded capitalist sinism with which the better-off people have always looked down on the poor. However, what he said in the debate on paragraph 219a went one step further: ""When it comes to the lives of animals, some who now want to promote abortions are uncompromising, but sometimes there is not much going on in this debate considers that it is about unborn human life. ""Who is campaigning for abortion? What is Spahn talking about? Advertising for abortion would be for example: ""Abortion: the best thing about the North."" Or: ""Abortion ... I like it!"" Maybe also: ""losing weight without sports."" Or just like in the L'Tur advertisement: ""Nix wie weg!"" But the new health minister should know that the discussion is not about advertising, but about information. Of course he knows that. Right-wing populists always sell their audiences more stupid than they are themselves. When rights talk: like bookseller Heinz Ostermann of Terror Hartz IV: Black-Red is supposed to be a coalition of small people. Ulrike Winkelmann has her doubts there

The CEC said that this year the current head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin won with a significant advantage. Vladimir Putin's re-election was already greeted by a number of foreign leaders. However, there were those who questioned the honesty of the process. Among those who congratulated the current head of Russia on the victory in the election - Chairman of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In his telegram, it is noted that ""at present, China-Russia relations of all-round strategic cooperation and partnership have reached an unprecedented high level."" In addition, the Foreign Ministry of China noted that they are preparing for the future visit of the Russian president. Presumably, it may take place in June as part of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Qingdao. Putin's dinner talks about the level of people's high trust, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko believes. ""This result demonstrates the high confidence and support of the citizens of Russia for the sustainable social and economic development of the country, strengthening its authority on the international arena,"" the congratulatory message says. Venezuelan and Nicolas Maduro and Raul Castro expressed condolences. The leader of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said that the result of voting in Russia was convincing: ""This victory testifies to your high political authority and active support of your course directed to ensure stability, law and order in the country, implementation of large-scale reforms, implementation of long-term social programs that contribute to the welfare of the people, ""it follows from Aliyev's message. Moldovan President Igor Dodon in his congratulations noted that today"" a strong Russia is needed not only for Russians "" President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier congratulated Vladimir Putin and I congratulate you and the citizens of the Russian Federation on their re-election, I wish you success during the new term, ""the website says. The leaders of other countries: Kyrgyzstan - Sooronbai Jeenbekov, Kazakhstan - Nursultan Nazarbayev, Egypt - Abdel Fattah as-Sisi, Armenia - Serzh Sargsyan, Iran - Hasan Rukhani and others. Wishing success for the next period of Putin's presidency. Serbian leader Alexander Vučić and Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said: ""The result you have achieved only confirms the wide support that you have for all the complex reforms that you have so far carried out successfully or are only intending to accomplish Odile. This shows that citizens see you as a true leader who is ready to meet all the challenges, ""Brnabic said."" Western countries have congratulations. On telephone conversations: today and tomorrow there will be a number of conversations. What comes through the diphinal ... until I would not talk, call the individual countries, then we will give generalizing information, ""the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitri told journalists Iy Peskov. Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum. On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair. And we drew attention to the Western media, which, under the influence of any lobby, make comments about the dishonesty of the elections. It's not so, ""he concluded.",RIA Novosti Ilham Aliyev Raul Castro Alexander Lukashenko Simferopol Left Shanghai Cooperation Xi Crimea Heiko Mass ARMENIA RUSSIA Vladimir Putin EGYPT Abdel Fattah Nursultan Nazarbayev Eli Hatem Frank Walter Presumably Belarussian Foreign Ministry IRAN Nicolas Maduro Serzh Sargsyan UKRAINE Sooronbai Jeenbekov FRANCE Igor Dodon Brnabic CHINA Angela Merkel Walter Steinmeier Hasan Sisi SWEDEN KYRGYZSTAN Ulf Grenlund SERBIA POLAND Cooperation Organization KAZAKHSTAN Poroshenko Andreas Maurer GERMANY Vučić Vlad

But on the people of the city of Afrin, in north-western Syria, Turkey's invasion on Sunday must have been like the appearance of an occupying power. Turkish soldiers hoisted the flag of their country over buildings of the administration. Their allies from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) plundered food, electrical appliances, motorcycles, goats, set fire to shops selling alcohol. Fighters drove forward with bulldozers and tore the statue of blacksmith Kawa, a Kurdish legend figure, from the pedestal. For Erdogan the conquest of Afrin means a military success. His army marched into the province of Afrin on January 20 to fight the Kurdish militia YPG. Piece by piece, the soldiers had moved from the border to the center of the province. Since the beginning of last week, they besieged the city of Afrin. Observers had forecast weeks, possibly months, of battles. Ultimately, however, the YPG retreated, with almost no resistance. ""The terrorists ran away with their tails tucked in,"" Erdogan mocked. Turkey has also defeated the world powers USA and Russia in Afrin, added one of its advisors. Government-run Turkish newspapers wrote on Monday about a ""Victory Day"" and a ""Day of Pride."" ""We wrote history in Afrin."" And even opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu spoke of a ""heroic battle"". ""Human lives count nothing"" For the majority of people in Afrin, however, the fall of their hometown is a disaster. Afrin was one of the few regions in Syria that had been largely spared the horror of the civil war so far. Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens, Yazidis found refuge here and lived side by side in a largely peaceful way. Tens of thousands are now on the run. People have to watch their homes being looted and do not know when and under what circumstances they can return. ""Here in Syria everyone has their own war,"" said a resident of Afrin Der Spiegel. ""Human lives count for nothing."" Erdogan is likely to feel affirmed in his war policy by defeating the YPG in Afrin. He sees the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdish terrorist organization PKK and has already announced that they want to pursue the militia to the border with Iraq. His government is currently negotiating with the US for a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from Manbij, a city east of Afrin. Turkish soldiers in Afrin respond to a journalist's question about their goals: ""Manbij, Aleppo, Kandil"" (PKK Headquarters). In the medium term, however, the military could take revenge on Turkey. Although Erdogan is self-confident: ""In the center of Afrin now the symbols of confidence and stability are blowing - and not the rags and terrorists,"" he said. But his Rhe Torik can not hide the fact that his government has no plan for a post-war order. It is easier to invade a country than to come out again. Erdogan calls the city of Jabulusul, the place that the Turkish soldiers co-operated with FSA a year and a half ago, as a blueprint for Afrin Fighters from the ""Islamic State"" and has been administered by Turkey ever since. But both cities can hardly be compared. Most of the Arabs live in Jabulus, who welcomed the Turkish soldiers and the FSA as a protective power. The Kurds in Afrin, on the other hand, regard Turkey as an intruder. Although not all residents of the city support the YPG yet, they are unlikely to accept a Turkish occupation without resistance.Othman Sheikh Issa, the deputy head of the Kurdish administration in Afrin, is threatening a guerrilla war: ""Our troops are in the entire vicinity of Afrin These troops will fight the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries wherever possible.

Framed the President | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html |  MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",SEYCHELLES District Columbia UNITED STATES Ms Ethics Toensing MANCHESTER Robert Clinton George diGenova Donald Bush John Dowd Mark Corallo Mueller Justice Department Jr RUSSIA Fox News Flood Trump Erik Prince Sam Clovis Columbia Joe Make Emmet Joseph Republican

Those involved in the feud, which centres around the Velt server operators, reportedly claimed their opponents engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. An unverified image on social media claims to show the email sent to schools saying: “The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time if you do not send $5,000.""It adds: “If you do not sent the money we will blow up the device.“If you try to call the cops we WILL blow up the device on the SPOT. ANY attempt at defusing it your self will cause it to explode.”Cardinal Road School in Feltham, Hounslow, is one of the schools evacuated in London.Schools in Stevenage, Watford, St Albans, Hemel Hempstead and Hertford have also received bomb threats.The Valley School in Stevenage decided to evacuate the pupils after receiving a bomb threat this morning.Hertfordshire police said: “We did not advise any schools ourselves to evacuate but The Valley School in Stevenage made the decision to evacuate and we sent officers to as sist them.”Carson Kallen, chief executive of VELT, the Michigan-based company that runs VeltPvP, told The Telegraph that they believe the email was set from ""a group of hackers”.""Please collect your child as soon as possible.""Schools in Chiswick, Ilford and Lambeth in the capital have also been evacuated.A Hounslow Council spokesman said: “Several schools are affected in Hounslow.""Initially we thought it was isolated to one school.

I can’t say if they have all been evacuated.“We are monitoring the situation very closely, and working with the police and taking our lead from them. “Schools have their own protocol in place and its up to them how they respond.”Our Lady Immaculate Catholic Primary school in Tolworth was also affected.The threats are being treated as a mass hoax.Orthodox Judaism comprehensive school the Kantor King Solomon, in Barkingside, east London tweeted: “There was a national threat made to lots of schools this morning and KKS went into evacuation to ensure the safety of our site.“This was in conjunction with CST and the Metropolitan Police.“We have established that there is no further threat and School is now running as normal.”A group of Putin-sympathisers was behind a similar series of bomb threats to schools across the UK and France in 2016.The group named ‘Evacuators 2K16’, which used a Russian email address ending in the domain ‘.ru’ said on Twitter they were behind the threats which targeted 14 schools in Britain and six in France.Its Twitter account said it supported the Assad regime in Syria. It told children to contact them if they wanted to “get out of school”.In Yorkshire, police said it had sent its Cybercrime Unit Detectives to look at the emails, and said “it is not believed there is any genuine threat”.The Met Police said eight schools were emailed in Hounslow, but it was up to the schools, not police, whether to evacuate.In Humberside, 12 schools have told police they have received the email, and have been told not to evacuate.Dowdales Secondary School in Dalton, Cumbria evacuated pupils as a precaution.Lakes College in Workington and North Lakes Primary School in Penrith also received the bomb threat in Cumbria.At least 35 schools have been affected in Northumbria, while nine were sent the threats in Lincolnshire.A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ""We have received reports from a large number of schools in our region they they have received threatening emails.""The emails inform the school that a bomb has been placed on the grounds and will be detonated if they don't hand over cash.""Detectives have looked into the emails, which appear to originate from the US, and can confirm there is no viable threat.""Schools have been visited by police to reassure them that the incident is being treated as a hoax and address any concerns.""We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and an investigation into the emails in question is underway.""A stateme nt from the Met Police said: “Police are investigating reports of communications made to a number of schools across London today, Monday, 19 March.“There have been no arrests.

After 161 days, the SPD base had agreed to a grand coalition. But already on the third day of the new government, a statement by the new Interior Minister Seehofer on Islam made for criticism - even from their own ranks. All information in the news ticker of FOCUS Online.14.17: Berlin - Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) supports the initiative of Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) for longer border controls. ""The Chancellor and the Interior Minister have agreed that an extension of the controls at the German border is currently necessary,"" said government spokesman Steffen Seibert on Monday in Berlin. Seehofer had called in the ""World on Sunday"", the European internal borders would have to be monitored until the external borders were protected, and also increased surveillance of internal borders brought into play. Germany had in September Started inspections in 2015 in view of the strong influx of refugees on the border with Austria. The controls take place on three cross-border highways and changing locations in the border area. In the so-called ""veiling investigation"", police officers can also check travelers without specific suspicion. According to the Ministry of the Interior, 16,000 unauthorized immigrants were picked up last year. 7,000 people were therefore rejected because they did not have a right of residence or a valid travel document or did not seek protection in Germany. In the vicinity of the Czech border, according to the ministry, the authorities registered 4,053 persons to whom they were subject to unauthorized entry, at the French border there were 3946 people, near Poland 2148, Monday, March 19, 11:31: The head of the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, Jörg Kukies, changes as a state secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance. This reported the Berlin ""Tagesspiegel"", citing informed circles. Kukies is a member of the SPD and was the predecessor of Andrea Nahles as Juso boss in Rhineland-Palatinate. Kukies has been co-chairman of Goldman Sachs in Germany since 2014. He has been working for the US investment bank in London and Frankfurt am Main since 2001. Goldman Sachs managers in politics are not uncommon, especially in the US. US President Donald Trump had temporarily appointed five different senior executives to the bank, including the current Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin. Even Trump's predecessor Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had appointed former Goldman Sachs managers to finance ministers. Meanwhile, the ""Handelsblatt"" reported, citing government circles, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) brings the longtime Secretary of State Werner Gatzer after only three months back in the Ministry. Gatzer had that The Ministry did not leave until the end of last year to hire Deutsche Bahn. At the beginning of January, he took over the position of Chairman of the Group Division Station & Service at the state-owned company. The subsidiary is responsible for the train stations in Germany.

The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets that China stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for access to its massive market.The situation remains fluid, and Trump has previously in his presidency backed off economic threats at the last minute. But he has shown a recent willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs — even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war and economists who warn such actions could ultimately hurt U.S. businesses.Trump was particularly determined to follow through on tariffs on China, as criticism of U.S.-
China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign, according to the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s plans.If implemented, the tariff package would be one of the broadest sets of economic actions imposed by a modern U.S. president agains t China and could draw retaliation, fraying the trade partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.“This looks much more like a president who is excessively eager to apply tariffs than a well-
calculated move to defend American interests,” said Phil Levy, who was a trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “There are real concerns about Chinese behavior on intellectual property, for example, but there are much more effective ways to address them.”Most U.S. businesses agree with the Trump administration’s criticisms of China. But many disagree with the administration’s strategy.“The U.S.-China Business Council believes that tariffs will do more harm than good in bringing about an improvement in intellectual property protection for American companies in China,” said John Frisbie, president of the council, a nonpartisan group of 200 U.S. companies that do business with China. “Business wants to see solutions to the issues, not just sanctions.”Other business groups endorsed the proposed tariffs. “This would be a clear indication that he’s serious about ensuring there are consequences for intellectual property violations and other ­anti-competitive practices coming from China,” said Scott Paul, president of the union-backed Alliance for American Manufacturing. “He’s not the first president who’s promised he would do something about China. But if he follows through with these tariffs, he’d be the first to ensure there are real consequences for these violations. That’s a step forward for American workers.”In 2017, China was the largest U.S. trading partner in goods
(not counting services), edging out Canada and then Mexico.
The United States exported $130.4 billion in goods to China, but it imported nearly four times as much, running a trade deficit of $375.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Economists specializing in China said that it would be difficult for the Trump administration to target Chinese companies because products imported from China are made by multinational companies with supply chains that stretch around the world.Chinese manufacturers might assemble these products or put on the finishing touches, but the country does not export as many products to the United States that are entirely made in China, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“So much of what we import from China is produced by multinational companies,” Lardy said. “Thirty percent are consumer electronics. I’m sure the president doesn’t want to raise the prices of those and send Apple’s stock into the toilet.”  It will be easier for China to hit back, Lardy said, as China can zero in on U.S. exports such as soybeans, which are entirely made in the United States. Soybeans are one of the top two goods the United States exports to China, along with aircraft and aircraft parts, according to government data.Lardy also said that penalizing China probably would not help U.S. producers, even if the tariff s succeeded in stemming the inflow of goods from China.“In the best case, they might reduce imports from China by $30 billion, but it will have virtually no effect on the U.S. global trade deficit,” he said. “We’ll just start buying things from the next lowest-cost supplier, such as Bangladesh or Vietnam. It’s not that the $30 billion will magically be produced in the United States the day after they announce these tariffs.”China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. It holds $1.17 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, down about $33.5 billion since last August. The U.S. government faces huge borrowing needs, not only to finance new deficits but also to refinance past securities now coming due, so a drop in China’s appetite for that debt could nudge interest rates up in the United States. But experts also note that China would not want to hurt the value of the huge amount of securities it still holds, leaving the two nations’ finances in a state of mutual semi-dependency.Beyond the escalating tensions with China, Trump’s pivot to protectionism has put much of the world on edge. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America first” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as the Republicans muscled tax cuts through Congress.That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.Trump earlier this month ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move U.S. allies and trading partners met with protests and threats of retaliatory tariffs. Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs and announced his resignation days before they were formally unveiled.Republican leaders in Congress criticized the metal tariffs, but the GOP is not planning legislation to overturn them. The party is also worried that Trump will withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact administration officials are renegotiating with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada.The U.S.-China Business Council noted that many states – including some swing states that propelled to an unexpected victory in 2016 – have seen sharp increases in exports to China. Over the decade ending 2016, Pennsylvania’s exports of goods to China increased 83 percent, twice the rate as its exports to the rest of the world. And Pennsylvania’s exports of services jumped more than four-fold, more than five times the pace as its services exports to the rest of the world. Exports from Michigan, another state Trump won, showed a similar pattern.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have argued China shoul d make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn’t work.Still, Trump’s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolating him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.David J.

Hello! This is Sergey, the editor. For a long time I watched Varlamov postulate his theses about the benefits of elections in Russia, but even my patience comes to an end.

No more strength to listen to this nonsense ... Maybe we will discuss?



1. You can not go to elections

Here everything is simple. If you are against the regime, but go to the polls, then you automatically contribute to its legitimization. If you are against Putin, but go to the polls, then you are for Putin. In today's Russia, the only adequate and only visible way to state your protest is to completely ignore the electoral system.

You are aware that without throwing in will not do. You know that, perhaps, the main opposition politician in the country is not allowed before the elections on artificial grounds. On your eyes, the regime in the most fantastic ways tries to increase the turnout, so that more sheep come to the slaughterhouse from the free pastures. But you still drag yourself to the site to pay your respects to Mr. Putin.

Remember: if you urge to go to the polls without fail to ""express your opinion"", then you are a man harmful to Russia. As harmful as any system manager from EdRa.

""Go on dick, beaver collar, I'm not going to play by your rules!"" - that's what you have to say.

Here an impatient reader, a dashing quilted jacket or a ""permitted"" apple-type liberal already wants to accuse me of sympathy for Navalny, but he is disappointed. I have no sympathy for Navalny. It was once, in 2009-2010, but it all came out.

The fact is that in the talent those instantly change their shoes Navalny is like a 9th grade student, at a rush to a kiosk for beer and cigarettes, but still unable to overcome the checkpoint on duty without a change.

In December 2011, Navalny shouted into the microphone that the Kremlin can be taken even now. In August 2013, he willingly used the signatures of ""EdRa"" to run for the post of the mayor of Moscow. Now that he was not allowed to vote before the elections, Navalny immediately made a poker deal and said that the election is, it turns out, full of bullshit, and all of us were dragged bad cats by the nose!

In short, this way: I am very grateful to the UVP of the Administration of the President of Russia for instructing Mr. Navalny and his supporters on the true path. So we will win!



Those who constantly go to the polls and then beleaguered polls from polling stations should ask themselves one simple question: what good happened in the political life of Russia in the past 6 and a half years?

Well, at first, the Moscow opposition tusovka moved from ""Jean-Jacques"" to Telegram (and some also abroad). This is the main achievement, I believe. Prisoners of Marsh went out of prison. Someone received fresh grants. The site ""Mediason"" (I'm serious this time: this is really very important and very useful). Katz and Gudkov conducted a municipal campaign, and then - you will not believe it! - razosralis ... And that defended the independent mundepy Moscow trolleybus or green blocks of Khrushchev? Ah ha ha ha ha!

A significant victory, in fact, was only one - the advent of Roizma on to Ekaterinburg. But it, as I understand it, some kind of concession to the authorities personally Prokhorov, and not you. In addition, Roizman was a political freak even by the standards of the opposition.

Nemtsov was killed. The system makers of Ulyukaev and Belykh are sitting. Semisystemist Urlashov is sitting. If even one more independent mayor or governor is elected, he will be imprisoned too. How do you like this situation, dear fans of campaigns for elections? Is this an honest game, or was the bottle neck just anatomical enough?


2. Putin's interest is not an invention of the Kremlin

Yes, here I agree with Varlamov. The blatant screams of demshiz that Putin does not enjoy popular support is some kind of enchanting delirium.

When the leader, pumped up with propaganda, gives the illusion of power and greatness to a humiliated (even if supposedly humiliated) country, this always brings fruit. This was the case when Hitler was building the ideology of his state on the basis of hatred of internal and external enemies. The masses applauded him when he seized Austria and tore Czechoslovakia apart. Europe was shaking and was unable to intervene ...

Does not it look like anything?


3. Russia is ruled by grandmothers

The core of Putin's electorate is women over 45 years old. The most fat layer of those who vote for Putin is a grandmother from the age of 60. Who sit at home, do nothing, watch television, enjoy the success of the country listed in the program ""Time"", and they want you all to live in shit.

Is it possible to change this statistics or somehow draw it to your advantage? Not sure. And in general, how much Putin can a country still swallow?

Kaza The dependence should be very simple: the worse the people live, the weaker the position of the government. But this is all nonsense. The historical experience of Russia (Ivan IV, Stalin - yes anyone) and the life of some modern states (DPRK, Venezuela, African dictatorships) clearly demonstrates that peoples are subject to the Stockholm syndrome no worse than individuals. This means that Russia will accept Putin until one of the two elements disappears: either Putin or Russia. Or maybe both.

And then I turn to the last point.


4. Salvation of drowning people - not business

So, the Russians have made their choice. For the next 20 years, a noble cross between the Politburo and the State Emergency Committee will rule the country. The other day you will for sure reveal the secret of stability and continuity of the process of getting up from your knees.

But since Russia is a country of forestry, when you cut a forest, you will surely fly to a well-groomed person. And there are some points to which you will have to take your understanding:

If suddenly it turns out that the cops shoved your child into a ""bobik"", taken to the police station and tortured all night with an electric shock, do not be too surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your mother has cancer, but you can not get painkillers for her, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your uncle was summoned from the reserve and sent off to fight somewhere, and there he was cut off his head, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your sister was carried away by feminism, and her brave Cossacks whipped her for this, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly ok It seems that your dog was knocked down by a buoyant judge on his BMW, and then you had to pay for the repair of his car, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that your business was squeezed out by an ethnic organized crime group, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the Kremlin was demolished, in order to build a shopping mall and an elite 40-story LCD, instead of it, do not be surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that a park was cut down next to your house and a temple and a junction built in its place, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that there is no longer a trolley and a tram in your city, although it has always been (even in the ""dashing 90s""), do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the road surface in your city has eroded to the mantle of the Earth, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your street was flooded with the blood of sacrificial rams, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 5,000 people were killed at the plant of your monotown, and then they closed the enterprise altogether, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that you can not go to Turkey or Egypt, because it requires an exit visa, which is given only to spies and artists of the Bolshoi Theater, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that all the decent products from the stores have disappeared, and instead of them there is a ""plastic porridge"" on the shelves, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that you were given a hectare of land in the Far East, and then the Ministry of Defense, FSO or the FSB seized it for their own needs, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your cottage has collapsed full th Heptyla Proton-M rocket with another satellite, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 30 years have passed, and no Russia is already there, do not be very surprised.

Those involved in the feud, which centres around the Velt server operators, reportedly claimed their opponents engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. An unverified image on social media claims to show the email sent to schools saying: “The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time if you do not send $5,000.""It adds: “If you do not sent the money we will blow up the device.“If you try to call the cops we WILL blow up the device on the SPOT.

The West believes Russia was responsible for the tragedy.Voloshin, 29, was a Su-25 pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force when the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky on July 17, 2014, leading to 298 deaths.Reports in Ukraine say he was found dead at his home in Mykolayiv from a gunshot wound. A murder probe has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities although initial reports suggest he took his own life.Work colleagues reported that he had been feeling 'depressed'. His wife said she heard a gun shot and ran to him. Reports say she called police and ambulance, but a team of paramedics was unable to save his life.After the Russian accusations originally made in December 2014 , Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force and since last year was acting director of Mykolayiv International Airport.A BBC documentary in 2016 highlighted the claims which directly conflict with the official Dutch-led probe into the air horror which insists MH17 was downed by a powerful surface-to-air Buk missile shot from pro-Russian rebel held territory.Voloshin said last year: 'I did not shoot down the MH17 Boeing. A former military mate of mine called (Evgeny) Agapov, a mechanical engineer, falsely gave evidence against me.'He stressed: 'We did not carry out flights on July 17. The mechanic also say s that three aircraft went out on a mission and I was the only one to return. But again this actually happened on the 23rd.'He said that the aircraft was carrying air-to-air missiles. There were no air-to-air missiles. I was carrying air-to-surface weapons for ground targets.'Russia had claimed Agapov was a credible witness from Dnipropetrovsk air base, where both men served.Agapov alleged the Ukrainian captain went on a sortie armed with air-to-air missiles, and returned without them soon after the Boeing 777 was downed.After landing, Voloshin was 'scared', muttering that the incoming 'aircraft' - supposedly MH17 - 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time', he claimed.The Russian Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, insisted that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony was credible.SBU official Markiyan Lubkivskyi countered that Voloshin was not engaged in combat flights on July 17, the day MH17 was downed, and had not used weapons against aerial targets in the current conflict.Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17.He said: 'A great deal of evidence, including data from satellite observation, has proved that terrorist groups controlled by the Russian military shot down the passenger aircraft'.They us ed 'a Russian BUK surface-to-air-missile system', he said.But Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said: 'The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly and without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed.'He 'personally' saw Voloshin's warplane 'loaded with R-60 type air-to-air missiles, with which Su-25 fighters were not normally equipped'.His aircraft returned without these missiles.Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force in 2016 claiming that he could not afford to raise his two children on his service pay.Reports since his death said that he had admitted to feeling 'suicidal'.Police said it was normal to launch a murder probe in such circumstances.",Markiyan Lubkivskyi SBU MH17 Airlines Air Force International Airport Alexander Bastrykin Evgeny Agapov RUSSIA Vladimir Putin MALAYSIA Dutch Mykolayiv Boeing Voloshin National Markin UKRAINE

I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia.

""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

Angela Merkel GERMANY EGYPT,"Germany | Historiker fragt: ""Gehört der Islam zu Deutschland?"" | https://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/historiker-fragt-gehoert-der-islam-zu-deutschland-a2378407.html |  Hardly Horst Seehofer is in his office as the new Federal Interior Minister, he denies that Islam belongs to Germany, and thus triggers as expected knee-jerk contradictions of the Federal Chancellor and CDU chair Angela Merkel and also various representatives of other parties and associations - as if we have not had a debate on this question several times without understanding on a general language. Had with the immigration of Turks and other Orientals in Germany Muslims came here and these now belong to our country, is not a question, as far as they are not in quasi But does the existence of Muslims in this country mean that Islam belongs to Germany, as the first Federal President, Christian Wulff, asserted in 2010? That was already the view of the Union parties - and not only there - many different: people he Kauder, head of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group, as well as the former Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich, for example, claimed the opposite and justified this - in the same sense as Seehofer - with the fact that Islam did not have influenced the traditions and identity of this country.Angela Merkel, who as chancellor had made her a master in weighing up, was probably trying to balance positions when she ambiguously suggested that Islam belonged to Germany as well as Muslims living here, ""we"" ( !), however, are ""based on the Christian-Jewish traditions."" Who are ""we"" and who are the Muslims who belong to this country, but apparently not with ""us"" because they stand on a different foundation? Chancellor and CDU chairman met, of course, with their attempt to balance vivid contradiction, especially since it is not only about the question of whether Islam is associated, but also whether or to what extent he should belong. Which Islam would be meant, wanted about Merkel's party colleague Wolfgang Bosbach know and asked if Islamist or even Salafist currents and Sharia should also belong to Germany. Still in the same direction, the Egyptian-born political scientist and former Muslim Brother Hamed Abdel-Samad went in an open letter to the Chancellor and demanded explain them to the citizens what Islam is, instead of just stating its affiliation. An explanation is The Chancellor had been as guilty as before, as well as an answer to the question of what she wanted to do against Islamization. When asked about it, she could not think of much more than to fool that many people who were afraid of Koran disbelief from Muslims , would not be bible itself. And Margot Käßmann, a trained pastor, wanted to take even worried Christians into prayer: Those who were ""afraid of full mosques"" would have to ""provide for full churches."" But church attendance and prayer would not have the Christians in the Middle East Hamed Abdel-Samad sneered at the two ""undisguised women"" - Merkel and Käßman. With the destabilization of state order in Iraq and Syria, Christianity, which has been part of the country for 2000 years, was largely helpless at the mercy of Muslim extremist terror. Many Christians from there, who sought protection here, as well as Yazidi suffered violence in some refugee housing by Muslims who had also made their way to us. Refugees who wanted to carry out religious conflicts in their countries of origin did not belong to us Hereby, said Aiman ​​Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. He probably wanted to meet the widespread and legitimate concern that with the refugee masses from the Orient increasingly extremists could haunt our country. Extremism would have nothing to do with Islam, one hears mantra-like from the mouth of Muslim representatives and party representatives, when extremists, referring to Islamic laws scorching and murdering moved through the country. ""Islam means peace,"" it says softly from the mouth of nice as well as obscure headscarves who in some places on the day of the open mosque greet the guests with flowers, as observed in mosque visits on the day as well as the reaction of many guests who nod in such a well-intentioned peace agreement and smile as if they were alms refuses to learn this from a vocation and, to that extent, does not have to fear that opponents of Islam might be right in their warnings; for a fear of this kind is just as symptomatic of Islamophobia as the fear of those for whom peace in the name of Islam is nothing more than a synonym for submission and for whom an Islamization of Europe would be equivalent to the fall of the West. No matter what such fears must hold It may be absurd to assert on the one hand that Islam belongs to Germany, but on the other hand to denounce Islamization. How else could a membership of Islam have arisen if there had not been a development that led to it and the name Islamization quite true? For this does not mean just conversion or even submission, but also a territorial spread of Islam, which is logically followed with the mass immigration of Muslims, unless the immigrants have given up their religious customs.Perhaps, those who are open to this question publicly Report words, not be so obtuse, but first think about what can be understood by ""belonging"" everything.

The CEC said that this year the current head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin won with a significant advantage. Vladimir Putin's re-election was already greeted by a number of foreign leaders. However, there were those who questioned the honesty of the process. Among those who congratulated the current head of Russia on the victory in the election - Chairman of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In his telegram, it is noted that ""at present, China-Russia relations of all-round strategic cooperation and partnership have reached an unprecedented high level."" In addition, the Foreign Ministry of China noted that they are preparing for the future visit of the Russian president. Presumably, it may take place in June as part of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Qingdao. Putin's dinner talks about the level of people's high trust, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko believes. ""This result demonstrates the high confidence and support of the citizens of Russia for the sustainable social and economic development of the country, strengthening its authority on the international arena,"" the congratulatory message says. Venezuelan and Nicolas Maduro and Raul Castro expressed condolences. The leader of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said that the result of voting in Russia was convincing: ""This victory testifies to your high political authority and active support of your course directed to ensure stability, law and order in the country, implementation of large-scale reforms, implementation of long-term social programs that contribute to the welfare of the people, ""it follows from Aliyev's message. Moldovan President Igor Dodon in his congratulations noted that today"" a strong Russia is needed not only for Russians "" President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier congratulated Vladimir Putin and I congratulate you and the citizens of the Russian Federation on their re-election, I wish you success during the new term, ""the website says. The leaders of other countries: Kyrgyzstan - Sooronbai Jeenbekov, Kazakhstan - Nursultan Nazarbayev, Egypt - Abdel Fattah as-Sisi, Armenia - Serzh Sargsyan, Iran - Hasan Rukhani and others. Wishing success for the next period of Putin's presidency. Serbian leader Alexander Vučić and Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said: ""The result you have achieved only confirms the wide support that you have for all the complex reforms that you have so far carried out successfully or are only intending to accomplish Odile. This shows that citizens see you as a true leader who is ready to meet all the challenges, ""Brnabic said."" Western countries have congratulations. On telephone conversations: today and tomorrow there will be a number of conversations. What comes through the diphinal ... until I would not talk, call the individual countries, then we will give generalizing information, ""the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitri told journalists Iy Peskov. Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum. On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair. And we drew attention to the Western media, which, under the influence of any lobby, make comments about the dishonesty of the elections.

Framed the President | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html |  MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",SEYCHELLES District Columbia UNITED STATES Ms Ethics Toensing MANCHESTER Robert Clinton George diGenova Donald Bush John Dowd Mark Corallo Mueller Justice Department Jr RUSSIA Fox News Flood Trump Erik Prince Sam Clovis Columbia Joe Make Emmet Joseph Republican

McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Usually Mike Michael Fake Memos Robert Bromwich Ronald Reagan Dem Mueller Brennan Andrew RUSSIA Vicki Divoll Trump Nixon Louis Leon Zero Republicans Capitol Hill McCabe Enterprise Institute Republican UNITED STATES John Freeh Dowd Clinton Senate Intelligence Intelligence Committee Andy Fox News Gary Schmitt Jeremy Bash Lewinsky Richard James Comey GERMANY Panetta Bob Obama

The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China. The most recent prediction involved an episode from almost 20 years ago that predicted Walt Disney Co. took over 21st Century Fox Inc.The November 8, 1998 episode titled 'When You Dish Upon a Star' of the show accurately predicted that one day Disney would take over Fox. In February, it also came to light that The Simpsons predicted the USA would win curling gold and Sweden silver in Winter Olympics Curling, as part of an episode that first aired EIGHT years ago.The prediction features in the 'Boy meets Curl' episode, as Homer and Marge lead Team USA to victory.",Saved Lisa Team Rhyme Century Fox Producer Matt Groening Bengt Holmström Bravo Emc Hawkings Executive Producer United Trump Dish Wasn Future Simpsons Bart Lady Gaga Stephen Hawking UNITED STATES Higgs Boson Matt Sellman Nicely CHINA GREECE Nobel Prize Walt Disney Hollywood Donald Albert Einstein Star Arab Spring SWEDEN FIFA Trumptastic Voyage Fans Galileo Galilei Ebola Super Bowl Brief History Dan Greaney Awesome GERMANY Brain

The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect. What is absolutely clear is our full solidarity with the United Kingdom and our extreme concern about what has happened, that is extremely unacceptable.”",UNITED STATES BELGIUM SPAIN Sergei OPCW SLOVAKIA Russ Alexander Litvinenko CZECH REPUBLIC SWEDEN RUSSIA Vladimir Putin Chemical Weapons Convention Salisbury UNITED KINGDOM Federica Mogherini Boris Johnson Kingdom March Alfonso Dastis Novichok Yulia Skripal

Those involved in the feud, which centres around the Velt server operators, reportedly claimed their opponents engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. An unverified image on social media claims to show the email sent to schools saying: “The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time if you do not send $5,000.""It adds: “If you do not sent the money we will blow up the device.“If you try to call the cops we WILL blow up the device on the SPOT. ANY attempt at defusing it your self will cause it to explode.”Cardinal Road School in Feltham, Hounslow, is one of the schools evacuated in London.Schools in Stevenage, Watford, St Albans, Hemel Hempstead and Hertford have also received bomb threats.The Valley School in Stevenage decided to evacuate the pupils after receiving a bomb threat this morning.Hertfordshire police said: “We did not advise any schools ourselves to evacuate but The Valley School in Stevenage made the decision to evacuate and we sent officers to as sist them.”Carson Kallen, chief executive of VELT, the Michigan-based company that runs VeltPvP, told The Telegraph that they believe the email was set from ""a group of hackers”.""Please collect your child as soon as possible.""Schools in Chiswick, Ilford and Lambeth in the capital have also been evacuated.A Hounslow Council spokesman said: “Several schools are affected in Hounslow.""Initially we thought it was isolated to one school.

It told children to contact them if they wanted to “get out of school”.In Yorkshire, police said it had sent its Cybercrime Unit Detectives to look at the emails, and said “it is not believed there is any genuine threat”.The Met Police said eight schools were emailed in Hounslow, but it was up to the schools, not police, whether to evacuate.In Humberside, 12 schools have told police they have received the email, and have been told not to evacuate.Dowdales Secondary School in Dalton, Cumbria evacuated pupils as a precaution.Lakes College in Workington and North Lakes Primary School in Penrith also received the bomb threat in Cumbria.At least 35 schools have been affected in Northumbria, while nine were sent the threats in Lincolnshire.A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ""We have received reports from a large number of schools in our region they they have received threatening emails.""The emails inform the school that a bomb has been placed on the grounds and will be detonated if they don't hand over cash.""Detectives have looked into the emails, which appear to originate from the US, and can confirm there is no viable threat.""Schools have been visited by police to reassure them that the incident is being treated as a hoax and address any concerns.""We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and an investigation into the emails in question is underway.""A stateme nt from the Met Police said: “Police are investigating reports of communications made to a number of schools across London today, Monday, 19 March.“There have been no arrests.

The CEC said that this year the current head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin won with a significant advantage. Vladimir Putin's re-election was already greeted by a number of foreign leaders. However, there were those who questioned the honesty of the process. Among those who congratulated the current head of Russia on the victory in the election - Chairman of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping. In his telegram, it is noted that ""at present, China-Russia relations of all-round strategic cooperation and partnership have reached an unprecedented high level."" In addition, the Foreign Ministry of China noted that they are preparing for the future visit of the Russian president. Presumably, it may take place in June as part of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Qingdao. Putin's dinner talks about the level of people's high trust, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko believes. ""This result demonstrates the high confidence and support of the citizens of Russia for the sustainable social and economic development of the country, strengthening its authority on the international arena,"" the congratulatory message says. Venezuelan and Nicolas Maduro and Raul Castro expressed condolences. The leader of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said that the result of voting in Russia was convincing: ""This victory testifies to your high political authority and active support of your course directed to ensure stability, law and order in the country, implementation of large-scale reforms, implementation of long-term social programs that contribute to the welfare of the people, ""it follows from Aliyev's message. Moldovan President Igor Dodon in his congratulations noted that today"" a strong Russia is needed not only for Russians "" President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier congratulated Vladimir Putin and I congratulate you and the citizens of the Russian Federation on their re-election, I wish you success during the new term, ""the website says. The leaders of other countries: Kyrgyzstan - Sooronbai Jeenbekov, Kazakhstan - Nursultan Nazarbayev, Egypt - Abdel Fattah as-Sisi, Armenia - Serzh Sargsyan, Iran - Hasan Rukhani and others. Wishing success for the next period of Putin's presidency. Serbian leader Alexander Vučić and Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said: ""The result you have achieved only confirms the wide support that you have for all the complex reforms that you have so far carried out successfully or are only intending to accomplish Odile. This shows that citizens see you as a true leader who is ready to meet all the challenges, ""Brnabic said."" Western countries have congratulations. On telephone conversations: today and tomorrow there will be a number of conversations. What comes through the diphinal ... until I would not talk, call the individual countries, then we will give generalizing information, ""the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitri told journalists Iy Peskov. Despite the fact that while none of the world politicians questioned the legitimacy of the past elections, criticism of Moscow still sounded. In particular, German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass expressed the opinion that in terms of political competition everything was not going smoothly: ""The result of the elections in Russia surprised us as little as the circumstances of these elections. Of course, we can not speak about fair political competition on all points, ""RIA Novosti quotes his words. The most votes were criticized in Crimea, the results of which some countries have already refused to recognize. Among them, predictably made Ukraine. Its head, Piotr Poroshenko, said that all the results and appearance were falsifications and are not legal. ""Neither the recorded appearance, nor the drawn result correspond to the real activity of the inhabitants of the peninsula. The published official data are nothing more than falsification, ""he said in a special statement. The position of Kyiv was supported in Poland. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country has already issued a comment stating that the Polish authorities are protesting against Russia's actions in the Crimea: ""The Foreign Ministry recalls that Poland, along with the entire transatlantic community, expresses a strong protest against Russia's actions towards Ukraine. We stand for respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and consider Crimea part of the Ukrainian state. This also means that the presidential elections on the peninsula, conducted by the Russian authorities, can not be considered I'm legitimate, ""the document says."" The Crimea has always been an irritant for the EU countries, especially after the Crimean War of the XIX century, ""the press service of the French Foreign Ministry said. The European Union's policy towards the peninsula is today a kind of pendulum. On the one hand - impenetrable European politicians, on the other - the public that travels to the Crimea to see with their own eyes how and how the peninsula lives. Of course, the opinion of the West on the decision of millions of Russians who voted for Vladimir Putin does not influence, ""the parliamentarian stressed. Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel.

The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China. The most recent prediction involved an episode from almost 20 years ago that predicted Walt Disney Co. took over 21st Century Fox Inc.The November 8, 1998 episode titled 'When You Dish Upon a Star' of the show accurately predicted that one day Disney would take over Fox. In February, it also came to light that The Simpsons predicted the USA would win curling gold and Sweden silver in Winter Olympics Curling, as part of an episode that first aired EIGHT years ago.The prediction features in the 'Boy meets Curl' episode, as Homer and Marge lead Team USA to victory.",Saved Lisa Team Rhyme Century Fox Producer Matt Groening Bengt Holmström Bravo Emc Hawkings Executive Producer United Trump Dish Wasn Future Simpsons Bart Lady Gaga Stephen Hawking UNITED STATES Higgs Boson Matt Sellman Nicely CHINA GREECE Nobel Prize Walt Disney Hollywood Donald Albert Einstein Star Arab Spring SWEDEN FIFA Trumptastic Voyage Fans Galileo Galilei Ebola Super Bowl Brief History Dan Greaney Awesome GERMANY Brain

The incumbent president received 77% of the votes cast by the electors who took part in the elections, and more than 50% - from the total payroll structure, after processing 99.9% of the ballots. This happens in Russia for the first time. The population supports Putin's foreign and domestic policies, and there is no alternative candidate, analysts of Alfa Bank state. The powerful support of the population gives the president the mandate for economic reforms - but he is unlikely to use them, they believe. After the elections, the government will focus on budgetary policy, and structural reforms will push back into the background, the note by Alfa Bank notes. But the support of voters can strengthen Russia's attempts to challenge the dominant role of the United States in the world, analysts believe. Analysts believe that it is not possible to interpret the results of the election so unambiguously, says Kirill Tremasov, director of the analytical department of Loko-Investa: the main task for the next term is to revive the economy. Without solving this problem, Putin's nuclear electorate can significantly reduce, the expert continues. ""He was forgiven for the economic failure in these six years for the Crimea, which divided people with liberal views on the economy in two, no matter what they said, but this electorate in large cities is estimated at tens of percent,"" Tremasov argues. But another six years of stagnation would be a very difficult test for the population. Nevertheless, now the task of reviving the economy is most likely to be considered without serious structural reforms (courts, state regulation, privatization) and the main emphasis will be placed on credit stimulation of economic growth, Tremasov said. ""In the short term, this can give a positive result, and then interest in structural reforms will really disappear completely,"" he believes. As a rule, the ""window of opportunities"" for reforms opens immediately after the elections, noted the head of the Economic Expert Group Evsei Gurvich: the elected leader receives a mandate even for unpopular reforms. On the eve of the third term, Putin had already proposed a program of reforms, the main tasks of which included his May decrees. For example, he instructed by 2018 to increase investments to 27% of GDP, and labor productivity - by 1.5 times, to raise Russia in the World Bank rating on the conditions of doing business from 120th to 20th place, to increase real wages in 1 , 4-1.5 times, salaries of teachers, doctors and scientists - up to 100-200% of the average for the region. But after the elections, the incentives for reforms were weakened by high oil prices, and then the events in Ukraine and sanctions followed, priorities changed, Gurvich said: it was necessary to restore macroeconomic stability, and geopolitics came to the fore. These presidential elections were exceptional in that, that the winning candidate did not set out an economic program at all, Economist of the BCS Vladimir Tikhomirov: there were no program statements, and from the clarifications of the future agenda Putin did not dodge at all. But he links it to the fact that after the election, Putin will take unpopular measures - the president received a very strong mandate of trust. Now there are many fundamental problems that need to be addressed: to change the structure of the economy, reform the pension system, and improve the demographic situation, Tikhomirov lists: without reforms, the economy can not grow faster. Indicative will be the composition of the government - whether Putin will appoint reformers or leave the previous team, he concludes. Changes in the government will occur after the inauguration, Putin said on Sunday after the election. Last week Putin again instructed the government to ensure the growth rate of the Russian economy is higher than the world level. Russia's economy is returning to cyclical growth, but without structural reforms it will be low - about 1.5-2 % per year, was noted in the economic monitoring of the Russian Academy of Science and Technology. Three key reform strategies were discussed: the Ministry of Economic Development proposes to stake on the growth of investments, non-primary exports and labor productivity, the Center for Strategic Research (TsSR) Alexei Kudrin - on the growth of aggregate factor productivity and investments in the most productive sectors, the Stolypin Club of the business ombudsman Boris Titov - to support a moderately weak exchange rate and stimulate demand for import substitution. Kudrin proposed a budget maneuver to accelerate GDP growth: reduce непро unproductive expenditures and increase spending on education, health care and infrastructure. This possibility is discussed, the participants in the meetings in the government and the presidential administration told in January and Interfax was confirmed by the presidential aide Andrei Belousov. The CSR suggested investing 2.3% of GDP in human capital and infrastructure. In his message to the Federal Assembly, Putin announced an increase in spending on medicine and infrastructure, just 1.5% of GDP per year would be required to fulfill the president's message, according to Belousov (quoted by Interfax) .The question is where to get the money. You can increase tax revenues by reducing the shadow sector, optimizing the cost of social support, offered the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. The first proposal after the elections will be an increase in the personal income tax (now - 13%), Bloomberg reported. During Putin's new term, reforms can be held in the social spheres - education and healthcare, as well as the pension system: first of all, retirement age, says director of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics Natalia Akindinova. She also expects reforms in the sphere of public administration - the change in the work of control and supervisory bodies and elimination of duplicative functions of ministries. But without serious changes in the business climate and a decline in the state's share in the economy, it is not possible to increase the growth of investments in fixed assets, as Putin entrusted, and Akindinov is skeptical. By the long-term forecast of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics, by the end of Putin's new term, the growth rate of the economy will remain at the level of 2%.",Development Academy Alexei Kudrin Technology Evsei Gurvich Interfax Ministry Expert Group World RUSSIA Tikhomirov Vladimir Putin Akindinov BCS Anton Siluanov Andrei Belousov Kirill Tremasov Economic Expert Strategic GDP UKRAINE Alfa Bank Group Evsei Boris Titov,"Russia | Собчак попросила Путина помиловать режиссера Сенцова и брата Навального | https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2018/03/19/754241-sobchak-poprosila-putina |  TV host Ksenia Sobchak, during a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and former presidential candidates, asked the head of state to pardon people he considers political prisoners.

The West believes Russia was responsible for the tragedy.Voloshin, 29, was a Su-25 pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force when the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky on July 17, 2014, leading to 298 deaths.Reports in Ukraine say he was found dead at his home in Mykolayiv from a gunshot wound. A murder probe has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities although initial reports suggest he took his own life.Work colleagues reported that he had been feeling 'depressed'. His wife said she heard a gun shot and ran to him. Reports say she called police and ambulance, but a team of paramedics was unable to save his life.After the Russian accusations originally made in December 2014 , Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force and since last year was acting director of Mykolayiv International Airport.A BBC documentary in 2016 highlighted the claims which directly conflict with the official Dutch-led probe into the air horror which insists MH17 was downed by a powerful surface-to-air Buk missile shot from pro-Russian rebel held territory.Voloshin said last year: 'I did not shoot down the MH17 Boeing. A former military mate of mine called (Evgeny) Agapov, a mechanical engineer, falsely gave evidence against me.'He stressed: 'We did not carry out flights on July 17. The mechanic also say s that three aircraft went out on a mission and I was the only one to return. But again this actually happened on the 23rd.'He said that the aircraft was carrying air-to-air missiles. There were no air-to-air missiles. I was carrying air-to-surface weapons for ground targets.'Russia had claimed Agapov was a credible witness from Dnipropetrovsk air base, where both men served.Agapov alleged the Ukrainian captain went on a sortie armed with air-to-air missiles, and returned without them soon after the Boeing 777 was downed.After landing, Voloshin was 'scared', muttering that the incoming 'aircraft' - supposedly MH17 - 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time', he claimed.The Russian Investigative Committee, headed by Alexander Bastrykin, a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, insisted that the witness has passed a polygraph test and his testimony was credible.SBU official Markiyan Lubkivskyi countered that Voloshin was not engaged in combat flights on July 17, the day MH17 was downed, and had not used weapons against aerial targets in the current conflict.Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, accused Moscow of using propaganda to 'hide the crimes organised by the Russian Federation, including against civilians' in relation to flight MH17.He said: 'A great deal of evidence, including data from satellite observation, has proved that terrorist groups controlled by the Russian military shot down the passenger aircraft'.They us ed 'a Russian BUK surface-to-air-missile system', he said.But Russian Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said: 'The facts and information that the witness possessed and shared - clearly and without getting confused - convince the investigators that his testimony is truthful, something that, by the way, a polygraph test has confirmed.'He 'personally' saw Voloshin's warplane 'loaded with R-60 type air-to-air missiles, with which Su-25 fighters were not normally equipped'.His aircraft returned without these missiles.Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force in 2016 claiming that he could not afford to raise his two children on his service pay.Reports since his death said that he had admitted to feeling 'suicidal'.Police said it was normal to launch a murder probe in such circumstances.",Markiyan Lubkivskyi SBU MH17 Airlines Air Force International Airport Alexander Bastrykin Evgeny Agapov RUSSIA Vladimir Putin MALAYSIA Dutch Mykolayiv Boeing Voloshin National Markin UKRAINE

Meanwhile, international observers who were present at polling stations throughout the voting on the peninsula note the transparency of the election process: ""The elections were transparent, organized at a high level, I did not notice violations,"" the German representative, the head of the faction, told a press conference in Simferopol Left party in the parliament of the city of Quakenbrück Andreas Maurer. And the observer from Sweden Ulf Grenlund agrees with him. ""It's normal, quiet (elections were held - RT), they did not see any real problems,"" he said. It should be noted that the election of the Russian president in the Crimea took place for the first time since his reunification with Russia in 2014. In addition, said a member of the Bar of Paris, Eli Hatem, also a former observer on March 18. He noted that all those who are trying to speculate on the fact that Vlad imir Putin once again became president, should pay attention to Angela Merkel. She, Hatem noted, became Chancellor for the fourth time: ""The elections in Russia were fair and fair. And we drew attention to the Western media, which, under the influence of any lobby, make comments about the dishonesty of the elections.

The UK says the Russian-developed nerve agent was responsible for the attempted killings and that all signs point to Vladimir Putin’s government being behind the incident in Salisbury on 4 March this year. Russia says allegations that it carried out the attack are “slanderous, groundless, and difficult to explain”, and has said that any stockpiles of Novichok would have been destroyed in accordance with international treaties.EU foreign ministers’ joint statement stopped short of directly blaming Russia in the way the UK government has, however, only stating that the “European Union takes extremely seriously the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible”.Foreign ministers were briefed by Boris Johnson on the issue before drawing up the joint statement. European Commission foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said arriving at the summit that the EU pledged “full solidarity” with the UK and said there was “extreme concern” about what happened. “The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years,” the joint statement says.“The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all. Any such use is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a breach of international law and undermines the rules-based international order.“The EU welcomes the commitment of the UK to work closely with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in supporting the investigation into the attack. The Union calls on Russia to address urgently the questions raised by the UK and the international community and to provide immediate, full and complete disclosure of its Novichok programme to the OPCW.“The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK’s efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. The EU will remain closely focussed on this issue and its implications.”Arriving at the summit Mr Johnson the Foreign Secretary warned the Russian government that it is “not fooling anyone” with its “increasingly absurd” denials of culpability for use of a nerve agent on British soil.He added that he had been “heartened” by support for the UK and that Britain was acting “in punctilious accordance with our obligations under the treaty on chemical weapons” – in contrast, he said, to Russ ia.Officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are arriving in the UK today to take samples of the nerve agent used in the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, he confirmed. The British government says the substance is Novichok, a Russian-developed weapon, but Russia has denied have any stockpiles of it. “The Russian denials grow increasingly absurd. At one time they say they never made Novichok, at another they say they did make Novichok but all the stocks have been destroyed, and then again they say that they made Novichok and all the stocks have been destroyed but some of them have mysteriously escaped to Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the United States, or even the United Kingdom,” he told reporters on the summit doorstep.“I think what people can see is that this is a classic Russia strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. What really strikes me talking to European friends and partners today is that 12 years after the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko in London they’re not fooling anybody anymore.“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected by some kind of malign of disruptive Russian behaviours. That is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today.”Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis told reporters as he arrived: “We think now the time is for an extended examination of all the elements involved with the participation of the OPCW. We are definitely going to keep the issue under consideration in the context of the EU, we’ll see.”EU foreign affairs chief Ms Mogherini said: “We have a particularly intense agenda today with the ministers. First and foremost we’ll hear from Boris Johnson for a debrief on Salisbury.“I would expect that well say something in the course of the morning so you’ll hear a renewed EU position in that respect.

FRANCE RUSSIA UNITED KINGDOM,"Russia | Воскрешение справедливости | https://russian.rt.com/opinion/493917-petrovskiy-voskreshenie-spravedlivosti |  At Alexanderplatz, the central square of East Berlin, ""under the clock"" (the main meeting place, something like ""near the Lenin monument"" in the Russian provincial city), yesterday a small company of compatriots gathered. I counted them 13, colleagues from one German radio station, which has a Russian wording, ""three dozen."" The company gathered around the plywood and the coffin painted with black paint, in which lay something wrapped in a Russian tricolor - according to the organizers of the performance, it was supposed to symbolize Russian democracy. To be completely understandable, there was also a poster with the inscription: ""Russian democracy - died without having lived."" Under the escort of seven policemen and with complete indifference of those around, the procession with the coffin passed through the central streets of Berlin to the Russian embassy, ​​where from the early morning there was a long line of those who wanted to vote. We got up to the ""picket"", stood, monotonously revered in a megaphone some kind of appeal. One of the participants of the performance told me that she would have voted for Ksenia Sobchak, but then she decided: ""I'd rather have fun and spend the day with my friends in the open air at such a rally."" Thirteen people on the dead man's chest against several tens of thousands who came to take part in the democratic procedure, that is, in elections - defeat is too shattering to laugh at it. This year, social networks showed photos of our embassies in Paris, Madrid, Prague and Phuket, where the long tails of an ocher In my opinion, there is something to analyze. Abroad, whether temporarily, permanently, now live, according to various estimates, from 25 million to 30 million Russian citizens. On most of these citizens, the level of medicine in the RF, the average salary, the amount of pensions and even sanctions do not have a direct effect. They are difficult to suspect that they do not receive any other information, except for what goes in Russia on state newspapers. Among them, there are no state employees whose well-being directly depends on the authorities. Finally - we will be completely honest - the Russian embassy for them is not a ""home"" and not ""a span of native land in a foreign land"", and not a very pleasant official institution, where they usually stand in queues on the usual days for papers and certificates. And yet they came. They stood in line, snapped the Selfie at the entrance, those that were with the children, showed the kids how to draw a bird in the right square. Why? ""I, in general, did not want to go. Theresa May forced, ""one of our fellow citizens told me inside the embassy. I immediately quoted him in my Telegram channel, after some time the federal television channel referred to the post, and today the headline ""Vladimir Putin secured a crushing victory ... thanks to Britain"" adorned the editorial The Times. Colleagues, are you reading me? That's right, who else will explain everything about the mysterious Russian soul? But if it's serious, it's not only and not so much in Teresa May. And not even in the pressure to which Russia is exposed at a global level and under which Russians, as it is commonly believed, are closer All the ranks. It's a shocking injustice of this pressure. This injustice - in the form of an intrusive but tolerable background - was felt a very long time, but after joining the Crimea it began to grow to absolutely indecent proportions. Why can not the Crimea, but Kosovo be possible? No answer. Who shot down the Malaysian Boeing? Nobody knows. To understand this, the Dutch side, with the observance of all possible protocols, handed over to the black boxes of the aircraft. Where is the transcript? Deciphering the negotiations of the pilots of all crashed civilian sideboards is in the public domain. After the crash of the Kachinsky plane, IAC posted the text the next day. So where is the MH17 record, the main evidence in the case on which so many absurd accusations have been put forward? Russian athletes can not be doped, while the Americans treat them with asthma and depression. Vladimir Putin can not be governed for 18 years, and Angela Merkel can. To all this, none of the accusers who have entered into the rug has long been trying to find intelligible explanations. ""You are to blame for what I want to eat."" Friends - everything, enemies - sanctions. And in this row the absurd j'accuse from Therese May, already laughing even by the British themselves, is only a cherry on the cake. It's exactly the other way around - deprived of the native information environment, which, as it can, softens the blows, they remain face to face with the local newspaper stands, every day telling about how they are enemies of democracy, from which they are already familiar with Putin - the tyrant. They say that the Russian soul os is sensitive to manifestations of injustice. I like the Russian like to think that this is so. But even if not - to resist injustice and persecution taught in the school of any normal person. And in this sense, between the tens of thousands that stood in line at the embassy, ​​and those who rallied on the other side of the street, there is no fundamental difference. Thirteen apostles of protest also thought that some injustice occurred in their attitude that their little voices were not heard and that if they walked along the street with a stupid coffin they would be heard better than if they crossed the road and would rise in the same queue. But the majority turned out to be on the other side. And voted not for stability and not for ""krymnas"". They voted for a single candidate who has the tools and the political will to withstand the huge injustice. And I hope that he will not disappoint them. And then our truth will finally rise from the ridiculous plywood grave.

State University Florida UNITED STATES,"United States | Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Arizona Pedestrian | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html |  SAN FRANCISCO — Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state’s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber — and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulati on. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.[Read more on how Arizona became a destination for self-driving car tests.]But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona’s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn’t reached a full floor vote.“This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America’s roads,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company’s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.”Tempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.“We needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,” Doug Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a “business-friendly and low regulatory environment” had helped the state’s economy.Even when an Uber self-driving car and another vehicle collided in Tempe in March 2017, city police and Mr. Ducey said that extra safety regulations weren’t necessary; the other driver was at fault, not the self-driving vehicle.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe’s ma yor, called Uber’s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a “responsible step” and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor “provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.”In California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine “the vehicle’s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.”Since late last year, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has been using cars without a human in the driver’s seat to pick up and drop off passengers in Arizona.Most testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called “disengage ments.”Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times — an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google’s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber’s cars have covered 3 million miles.In 2016, a man driving his Tesla using Autopilot, the car company’s self-driving feature, died on a state highway in Florida when his car crashed into a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road. Federal regulators later ruled there were no defects in the system to cause the accident.But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to self-driving cars, said Michael Bennett, an associate research professor at Arizona State University who h as been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence.“We’ve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it,” he said. “They’re going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe.”",California Lyft Volvo Highway Traffic UNITED STATES Richard Blumenthal Tempe Safety State University Ariz Senate Pittsburgh SAN FRANCISCO Google Toronto Autopilot Michael Bennett Silicon Valley Doug Ducey Florida Democrat Connecticut Arizona Waymo House Daniel Scarpinato Elaine Herzberg National San Francisco Cruise Jessica Gonzalez Sarah Abboud,"United Kingdom | Trump opioids plan includes death penalty for drug dealers | https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/donald-trump-death-penalty-drug-dealers-opioids-new-hampshire |  Donald Trump called on Monday for some drug dealers to receive the death penalty in a new opioids policy rollout in New Hampshire, a state hard hit by the national crisis.“We’re wasting our time if we don’t get tough with drug dealers, and that toughness includes the death penalty,” said Trump in typically combative style.He later added: “The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty. Maybe our country is not ready for that, it’s possible, it’s possible.” Trump said “personally I can’t understand that” about those opposed to such drastic measures.Some states already charge drug dealers with murder if customers overdose. In Florida, people who provide cocaine, heroin or the powerful opioid fentanyl to a person who dies from using the drug in question can be charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to either life in prison or death.Drug-induced homicide laws, which emerged in the 1980s, are being used more frequently because of the opioids crisis, according to a November 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance. However, there is no evidence that such laws reduce drug use.On Monday Trump was effectively sending a message to prosecutors to be harsher on drug dealers, who traffic in street drugs like heroin as well as black market prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, and various versions of the potent narcotic fentanyl. But he did not call specifically for legislation to expand use of the death penalty for federal drug crimes.The justice department said the federa l death penalty is already available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law.The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, attended the event on Monday and sat next to Melania Trump. The DoJ later issued a statement, saying: “At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.”Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear federal death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the supreme court.New Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: “We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – [it] is coming from the southern border.”The comment caused offence in the state, with the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan responding: “Instead of insulting people in the throes of addiction, [Trump] needs to work across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis.”Though Trump is visiting to lobby for harsher sentencing for opioid-relat ed crimes, New Hampshire is one of many states now pushing criminal justice reform.On Monday, the state judiciary announced it would review bail policies, after nationwide criticism of courts that serve as de facto debtor’s prisons for people too poor to pay bail.In 2012, substance use disorders such as opioid dependence cost New Hampshire $284m in criminal justice costs. More than half of jail and prison costs in the state are attributed to drug abuse, according to a report by the advocacy group New Futures. Nationally, 76% of inmates are believed to have substance use disorders, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has repeatedly highlighted his preference for the “ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.At a Pennsylvania rally this month, Trump told supporters countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.“The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” Trump said in remarks he echoed on Monday.Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump’s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the White House plan.T he president was joined in New Hampshire by the first lady, Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.Trump’s plan concerns law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. It also includes broadening education and awareness, expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts and government funding for efforts to develop non-addictive painkillers. He also said that the Department of Justice was “looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies.” Leading opioids makers in the US are already engulfed in a flurry of civil litigation brought by cities, counties and states.Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We call it the crisis next door because everyone knows someone,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser. “This is no longer somebody else’s community, somebody else’s kid, somebody else’s co-worker.”",OxyContin Congress Donald Trump York Statistics UNITED STATES New Hampshire Ohio State Drug Futures Melania Florida Bureau Policy Alliance Kellyanne Conway Doug Berman Chicago SINGAPORE Andrew Bremberg State University Jeff Sessions Los Angeles Maggie Hassan Justice
Google UNITED STATES Senate,"United States | Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Arizona Pedestrian | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html |  SAN FRANCISCO — Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago. Promising to keep oversight light, they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the state’s roads.Then on Sunday night, an autonomous car operated by Uber — and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel — struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe, Ariz. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with self-driving technology. The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.The accident was a reminder that self-driving technology is still in the experimental stage, and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it.Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face.It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads.Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulati on. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive.[Read more on how Arizona became a destination for self-driving car tests.]But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona’s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat.Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn’t reached a full floor vote.“This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America’s roads,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the company’s sensing system, was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman, on Sunday around 10 p.m.Sgt. Ronald Elcock, a Tempe police spokesman, said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms. Herzberg, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment. The weather was clear and dry.Uber said it would work with the police.“Our hearts go out to the victim’s family,” an Uber spokeswoman, Sarah Abboud, said in a statement. “We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.”Tempe, with its dry weather and wide roads, was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles. In 2015, Arizona officials declared the state a regulation-free zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber, Waymo and Lyft.“We needed our message to Uber, Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas,” Doug Ducey, Arizona’s governor, said in an interview in June 2017.Using an executive order, Mr. Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel, ready to take over in an emergency. He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned self-driving cars, noting that a “business-friendly and low regulatory environment” had helped the state’s economy.Even when an Uber self-driving car and another vehicle collided in Tempe in March 2017, city police and Mr. Ducey said that extra safety regulations weren’t necessary; the other driver was at fault, not the self-driving vehicle.But on Monday, Mark Mitchell, Tempe’s ma yor, called Uber’s decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a “responsible step” and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the updated order from the governor “provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents.”In California, where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted, Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles, said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash. Waymo, Lyft and Cruise, an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors, did not respond to requests for comment.In a news release, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine “the vehicle’s interaction with the environment, other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists.”Since late last year, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company Alphabet, has been using cars without a human in the driver’s seat to pick up and drop off passengers in Arizona.Most testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong. It can be challenging, however, to take control of a fast-moving vehicle.California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle, called “disengage ments.”Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times — an average of about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Uber has not been testing its self-driving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers.Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior. Still, most researchers believe self-driving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts.In 2016, 37,461 people died in traffic-related accidents in the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That amounts to 1.18 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016.Waymo, which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Google’s self-driving car project, has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Uber’s cars have covered 3 million miles.In 2016, a man driving his Tesla using Autopilot, the car company’s self-driving feature, died on a state highway in Florida when his car crashed into a tractor-trailer that was crossing the road.

Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds | https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/19/where-is-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-cambridge-analytica-scandal |  The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices, and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook.Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people.The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question.The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly.“If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement.The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unl ikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement.On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google.“It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee.Referencing the government’s request for Facebook’s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica’s offices, Collins tweeted: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.”The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time.Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform.Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence.Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation.Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.”The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August.“Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.”Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing.",Information Commissioner UNITED STATES John Kennedy Global Science WheresZuck Alex Stamos Science Research Senate Ron Wyden Google Cambridge Analytica Stroz Friedberg RUSSIA Damian Collins UNITED KINGDOM CSO DeleteFacebook CEOs Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg UK
Trump CHINA UNITED STATES,"United States | Trump prepared to hit China with $60 billion in annual tariffs | https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-prepared-to-hit-china-with-60-billion-in-annual-tariffs/2018/03/19/fd5e5874-2bb7-11e8-b0b0-f706877db618_story.html |  President Trump is preparing to impose a package of $60 billion in annual tariffs against Chinese products, following through on a longtime threat that he says will punish China for intellectual property theft and create more U.S. jobs.The tariff package, which Trump plans to unveil by Friday, was confirmed by four senior administration officials.Senior aides had presented Trump with a $30 billion tariff package that would apply to a range of products, but Trump directed them to roughly double the scope of the new trade levies. The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets that China stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for access to its massive market.The situation remains fluid, and Trump has previously in his presidency backed off economic threats at the last minute. But he has shown a recent willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs — even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war and economists who warn such actions could ultimately hurt U.S. businesses.Trump was particularly determined to follow through on tariffs on China, as criticism of U.S.-
China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign, according to the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s plans.If implemented, the tariff package would be one of the broadest sets of economic actions imposed by a modern U.S. president agains t China and could draw retaliation, fraying the trade partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.“This looks much more like a president who is excessively eager to apply tariffs than a well-
calculated move to defend American interests,” said Phil Levy, who was a trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “There are real concerns about Chinese behavior on intellectual property, for example, but there are much more effective ways to address them.”Most U.S. businesses agree with the Trump administration’s criticisms of China. But many disagree with the administration’s strategy.“The U.S.-China Business Council believes that tariffs will do more harm than good in bringing about an improvement in intellectual property protection for American companies in China,” said John Frisbie, president of the council, a nonpartisan group of 200 U.S. companies that do business with China. “Business wants to see solutions to the issues, not just sanctions.”Other business groups endorsed the proposed tariffs. “This would be a clear indication that he’s serious about ensuring there are consequences for intellectual property violations and other ­anti-competitive practices coming from China,” said Scott Paul, president of the union-backed Alliance for American Manufacturing. “He’s not the first president who’s promised he would do something about China. But if he follows through with these tariffs, he’d be the first to ensure there are real consequences for these violations. That’s a step forward for American workers.”In 2017, China was the largest U.S. trading partner in goods
(not counting services), edging out Canada and then Mexico.
The United States exported $130.4 billion in goods to China, but it imported nearly four times as much, running a trade deficit of $375.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Economists specializing in China said that it would be difficult for the Trump administration to target Chinese companies because products imported from China are made by multinational companies with supply chains that stretch around the world.Chinese manufacturers might assemble these products or put on the finishing touches, but the country does not export as many products to the United States that are entirely made in China, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“So much of what we import from China is produced by multinational companies,” Lardy said. “Thirty percent are consumer electronics. I’m sure the president doesn’t want to raise the prices of those and send Apple’s stock into the toilet.”  It will be easier for China to hit back, Lardy said, as China can zero in on U.S. exports such as soybeans, which are entirely made in the United States. Soybeans are one of the top two goods the United States exports to China, along with aircraft and aircraft parts, according to government data.Lardy also said that penalizing China probably would not help U.S. producers, even if the tariff s succeeded in stemming the inflow of goods from China.“In the best case, they might reduce imports from China by $30 billion, but it will have virtually no effect on the U.S. global trade deficit,” he said. “We’ll just start buying things from the next lowest-cost supplier, such as Bangladesh or Vietnam. It’s not that the $30 billion will magically be produced in the United States the day after they announce these tariffs.”China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. It holds $1.17 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, down about $33.5 billion since last August. The U.S. government faces huge borrowing needs, not only to finance new deficits but also to refinance past securities now coming due, so a drop in China’s appetite for that debt could nudge interest rates up in the United States. But experts also note that China would not want to hurt the value of the huge amount of securities it still holds, leaving the two nations’ finances in a state of mutual semi-dependency.Beyond the escalating tensions with China, Trump’s pivot to protectionism has put much of the world on edge. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America first” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as the Republicans muscled tax cuts through Congress.That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.Trump earlier this month ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move U.S. allies and trading partners met with protests and threats of retaliatory tariffs. Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs and announced his resignation days before they were formally unveiled.Republican leaders in Congress criticized the metal tariffs, but the GOP is not planning legislation to overturn them. The party is also worried that Trump will withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact administration officials are renegotiating with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada.The U.S.-China Business Council noted that many states – including some swing states that propelled to an unexpected victory in 2016 – have seen sharp increases in exports to China. Over the decade ending 2016, Pennsylvania’s exports of goods to China increased 83 percent, twice the rate as its exports to the rest of the world. And Pennsylvania’s exports of services jumped more than four-fold, more than five times the pace as its services exports to the rest of the world. Exports from Michigan, another state Trump won, showed a similar pattern.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have argued China shoul d make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn’t work.Still, Trump’s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolating him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.David J.

And he heaped plenty of scorn on the people he believes are responsible for as many as 42,000 U.S. deaths per year.""These are terrible people and we have to get tough with those people,"" Trump said of traffickers and dealers. ""This isn’t about committees... this is about winning a very tough problem.""""The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty,"" Trump said, before musing, ""maybe our country is not ready for that.""Trump wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain illicit opioids. The death penalty would be pursued where appropriate under current law. Justice Department says the federal death penalty is available for several limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the ""drug kingpin"" provisions in federal law.Trump reiterated an observation he has shared several times before -- that a person in the U.S. can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but that a drug dealer whose actions could lead to thousands of overdoses can spend little or no time in jail.The president said the feder al government may consider aggressive litigation against pharmaceutical companies deemed complicit in the crisis.""Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you and we will arrest you and we will hold you accountable,"" Trump said.Trump singled out Mexico and China as main sources of illicit opioids. A Drug Enforcement Administration report last year said: ""Seizures indicated that China supplies lower volumes of high-purity fentanyl, whereas fentanyl seizures from Mexico are higher volume but lower in purity.""Smuggling operations in both countries constantly try to elude U.S. officials by selling through the Internet and sending the substances – which chemists for these traffickers often alter to avoid detection – through the U.S. postal service, U.S. officials have said.Trump also announced a nationwide public awareness campaign, as well as increased research and development through public-private partnerships between the federal National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies. He announced a new website, Crisisnextdoor.gov, where people can share their stories about addiction. The hope is that horror stories will scare people away from behavior that could lead to addiction.The Trump administration aims to see the number of filled opioid prescriptions cut by one-third within three years.A third part of the plan addresses improving access to treatment and recovery p rograms that have proven effective. Many health professionals, relatives of those who have died of overdoses and people who have experienced addiction to opioids have been pushing for treatment to be a key component of any campaign to fight the epidemic.""Failure is not an option,"" the president said. ""Addiction is not our future. We will liberate our country from this crisis.""Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a recent CDC report said that the number of people checking into the emergency room after overdosing rose by 30 percent between July 2016 and September 2017.""Drug dealers show no respect for human dignity and put their own greed ahead of the safety and even the lives of others. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent and deadly business: if you want to collect a drug debt, you collect it with the barrel of a gun. As surely as night follows day, violence and death follow drug trafficking, and murder is often a tool of drug traffickers,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions reacted. ""At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.""""We cannot arrest our way out of the opioid epidemic—we tried that and ended up with an even bigger addiction problem and the world’s largest prison population,"" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, R-Ill., responded. ""The war on drugs didn’t work in the 80’s, and it won’t work now by reviving failed deterrence measures like the death penalty for drug dealers.  We must instead crack down on the over-production and over-prescribing of painkillers, and increase treatment for those suffering from addiction—both of which have bipartisan support in Congress.""Last October, Trump declared the crisis a national public health emergency, short of the national state of emergency sought by a presidential commission he put together to study the issue.Meanwhile, Congress plans to weigh a range of bills targeted at curbing the epidemic. The bills cover everything from improving access to treatment to intercepting shipments of illicit opioids en route to the United States.""Our recommendations will be urgent and bipartisan, and they will come very quickly,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to published reports.Fox News' Jason Donner, Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Congress Disease Control MEXICO UNITED STATES CHINA Dick Durbin News Jason Jake Gibson Labor Associated Minority Whip Enforcement Administration Drug Enforcement Centers Fox News Trump Education Health Whip Dick Ill Pensions Committee Jason Donner Addiction Senate Minority,"United Kingdom | The Simpsons predict Stephen Hawking's fate 19 years early | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5518033/The-Simpsons-predict-Stephen-Hawkings-fate-19-years-early.html |  It's the cartoon comedy believed to have predictedDonald Trump's presidency, the Ebola crisis and Bengt Holmström winning the Nobel Prize.Now fans believe The Simpsons may have hinted at a greater cosmological link between physicists Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, almost two decades before Hawking would die on the day that his German counterpart was born.The eerie link was uncovered this weekend as producers aired the 1999 episode - entitled They Saved Lisa's Brain - in which Hawking stars, as a tribute to his death on Wednesday 14 March.The scene features Hawking - who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 - performing in a rap called 'A Brief History Of Rhyme' - a play on his famous volume of work.With turntables fixed to his wheelchair, his animated character is also kitted out with a gold chain, which features formula made famous by Einstein, E = mc2. The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!'

Trump UNITED STATES Donald,"United States | Trump to Hire Lawyer Who Has Pushed Theory That Justice Dept. Framed the President | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html |  MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",SEYCHELLES District Columbia UNITED STATES Ms Ethics Toensing MANCHESTER Robert Clinton George diGenova Donald Bush John Dowd Mark Corallo Mueller Justice Department Jr RUSSIA Fox News Flood Trump Erik Prince Sam Clovis Columbia Joe Make Emmet Joseph Republican,"United Kingdom | The Simpsons predict Stephen Hawking's fate 19 years early | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5518033/The-Simpsons-predict-Stephen-Hawkings-fate-19-years-early.html |  It's the cartoon comedy believed to have predictedDonald Trump's presidency, the Ebola crisis and Bengt Holmström winning the Nobel Prize.Now fans believe The Simpsons may have hinted at a greater cosmological link between physicists Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, almost two decades before Hawking would die on the day that his German counterpart was born.The eerie link was uncovered this weekend as producers aired the 1999 episode - entitled They Saved Lisa's Brain - in which Hawking stars, as a tribute to his death on Wednesday 14 March.The scene features Hawking - who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 - performing in a rap called 'A Brief History Of Rhyme' - a play on his famous volume of work.With turntables fixed to his wheelchair, his animated character is also kitted out with a gold chain, which features formula made famous by Einstein, E = mc2.

Florida Chicago UNITED STATES,"United States | Parkland Survivors Call Out Media For Ignoring Gun Violence In Black Communities | https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parkland-gun-violence-black-communities_us_5ab00986e4b0e862383a68f9 |  A group of students who survived last month’s deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, slammed the media for not dedicating enough coverage to gun violence in black communities.David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman shot and killed 17 people on Feb. 14, called that unequal coverage one of the “greatest obstacles” that #NeverAgain, a student-led anti-gun violence movement created since the massacre, is trying to overcome.“There is a lot of racial disparity in the way that this [shooting] is covered,” Hogg, 17, said Monday during a live Q&A on Twitter.“If this happened in a place of a lower socioeconomic status or ... a black community, no matter how well those people spoke, I don’t think the media would cover it the same,” Hogg continued. “We have to use our white privilege now to make sure that all of the people that have died as a result of [gun violence] and haven’t been covered the same can now be heard.”Six Stoneman Douglas students turned #NeverAgain activists ― Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, Alex Wind, Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch and Cameron Kasky ― acknowledged the disproportionate effect gun violence has on people of color as well as those living in poorer communities.“We’re an affluent community ― that’s why initially everybody followed this [shooting] so closely,” Kasky, 17, said during the Twitter Q&A. “There are communities that ... have to deal with [gun violence] on a much more regular basis and have to feel a lot less safe than we do.”People of color are more often affected by gun violence in the United States, yet the media and the American public have paid comparatively little attention to their stories. While the media has elevated the voices of Parkland survivors, activists of color have discussed why shootings in their communities and their own calls to action are largely ignored.A group of Parkland survivors met with students from Chicago earlier this month to discuss how gun violence affects their community and how they can work together to keep everyone safer. These students, as well as others disproportionately harmed by gun violence, are now slated to speak at March For Our Lives, a massive protest against gun violence to be held on March 24 in Washington, D.C.“We have to represent those who unfortunately were ignored,” Kasky said on Monday. “This is not just about us. ... When we’re together marching, this is not going to be different races, different generations ― this is going to be a unified people standing together against those who are trying to ignore us.”Parkland survivors’ discussion of media coverage begins around the 30-minute mark in the footage below.",Alex Wind Florida David Hogg UNITED STATES Emma Gonzalez NeverAgain Parkland Ryan Deitsch Chicago Jaclyn Corin Cameron Kasky,"United Kingdom | Trump opioids plan includes death penalty for drug dealers | https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/donald-trump-death-penalty-drug-dealers-opioids-new-hampshire |  Donald Trump called on Monday for some drug dealers to receive the death penalty in a new opioids policy rollout in New Hampshire, a state hard hit by the national crisis.“We’re wasting our time if we don’t get tough with drug dealers, and that toughness includes the death penalty,” said Trump in typically combative style.He later added: “The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty. Maybe our country is not ready for that, it’s possible, it’s possible.” Trump said “personally I can’t understand that” about those opposed to such drastic measures.Some states already charge drug dealers with murder if customers overdose. In Florida, people who provide cocaine, heroin or the powerful opioid fentanyl to a person who dies from using the drug in question can be charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to either life in prison or death.Drug-induced homicide laws, which emerged in the 1980s, are being used more frequently because of the opioids crisis, according to a November 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance. However, there is no evidence that such laws reduce drug use.On Monday Trump was effectively sending a message to prosecutors to be harsher on drug dealers, who traffic in street drugs like heroin as well as black market prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, and various versions of the potent narcotic fentanyl. But he did not call specifically for legislation to expand use of the death penalty for federal drug crimes.The justice department said the federa l death penalty is already available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law.The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, attended the event on Monday and sat next to Melania Trump. The DoJ later issued a statement, saying: “At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.”Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear federal death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the supreme court.New Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: “We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – [it] is coming from the southern border.”The comment caused offence in the state, with the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan responding: “Instead of insulting people in the throes of addiction, [Trump] needs to work across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis.”Though Trump is visiting to lobby for harsher sentencing for opioid-relat ed crimes, New Hampshire is one of many states now pushing criminal justice reform.On Monday, the state judiciary announced it would review bail policies, after nationwide criticism of courts that serve as de facto debtor’s prisons for people too poor to pay bail.In 2012, substance use disorders such as opioid dependence cost New Hampshire $284m in criminal justice costs. More than half of jail and prison costs in the state are attributed to drug abuse, according to a report by the advocacy group New Futures. Nationally, 76% of inmates are believed to have substance use disorders, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has repeatedly highlighted his preference for the “ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.At a Pennsylvania rally this month, Trump told supporters countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.“The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” Trump said in remarks he echoed on Monday.Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump’s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the White House plan.T he president was joined in New Hampshire by the first lady, Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.Trump’s plan concerns law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. It also includes broadening education and awareness, expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts and government funding for efforts to develop non-addictive painkillers. He also said that the Department of Justice was “looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies.” Leading opioids makers in the US are already engulfed in a flurry of civil litigation brought by cities, counties and states.Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We call it the crisis next door because everyone knows someone,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser. “This is no longer somebody else’s community, somebody else’s kid, somebody else’s co-worker.”",OxyContin Congress Donald Trump York Statistics UNITED STATES New Hampshire Ohio State Drug Futures Melania Florida Bureau Policy Alliance Kellyanne Conway Doug Berman Chicago SINGAPORE Andrew Bremberg State University Jeff Sessions Los Angeles Maggie Hassan Justice
Trump GERMANY UNITED STATES,"United States | ‘You Will Not Destroy America’: A Trump Battle Is No Longer One-Sided | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html |  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Usually Mike Michael Fake Memos Robert Bromwich Ronald Reagan Dem Mueller Brennan Andrew RUSSIA Vicki Divoll Trump Nixon Louis Leon Zero Republicans Capitol Hill McCabe Enterprise Institute Republican UNITED STATES John Freeh Dowd Clinton Senate Intelligence Intelligence Committee Andy Fox News Gary Schmitt Jeremy Bash Lewinsky Richard James Comey GERMANY Panetta Bob Obama,"United Kingdom | The Simpsons predict Stephen Hawking's fate 19 years early | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5518033/The-Simpsons-predict-Stephen-Hawkings-fate-19-years-early.html |  It's the cartoon comedy believed to have predictedDonald Trump's presidency, the Ebola crisis and Bengt Holmström winning the Nobel Prize.Now fans believe The Simpsons may have hinted at a greater cosmological link between physicists Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, almost two decades before Hawking would die on the day that his German counterpart was born.The eerie link was uncovered this weekend as producers aired the 1999 episode - entitled They Saved Lisa's Brain - in which Hawking stars, as a tribute to his death on Wednesday 14 March.The scene features Hawking - who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 - performing in a rap called 'A Brief History Of Rhyme' - a play on his famous volume of work.With turntables fixed to his wheelchair, his animated character is also kitted out with a gold chain, which features formula made famous by Einstein, E = mc2.

In a statement, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy said his condition worsened and he was no longer able to stand up, so his veterinary team decided to euthanize him.Sudan was captured in Sudan in 1975, when he was just two years old, and was taken to Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic. But as that zoo fell into financial troubles and rhinos failed to breed, Sudan was relocated in 2009 to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Laikipia County, Kenya, along with two northern white rhino females named Najin and Fatu.The thinking was that in a place closely resembling their homeland, they would thrive. Northern white rhinos used to be found in an area spanning Uganda, Chad, southwestern Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some 2,000 existed in 1960, according to the World Wildlife Fund, but war and the poaching that funded the fighting drove them to extinction in the wild.Joseph Thaida, who took care of Sudan at the conservancy since 2012, remembers him as an affectionate and gentle rhino who had his picture taken with tourists and served as the centerpiece of publicity stunts. The most famous was when S udan got his own Tinder profile last year, to bring attention to the plight of his sub-species and direct donations to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for research on assisted reproductive technologies for rhinos.""Whenever he hears people talking, he loves to come close, because he knows he's gonna be scratched,"" Thaida told NPR last year.Thaida remembered when Sudan arrived at the conservancy, watching him as he studied the southern white rhinos already there. Sudan learned how to sharpen his horn using a tree. He began to graze and wallow in mud like his genetic cousins.After years in captivity, Sudan finally learned to become a rhino at this conservancy, Thaida believed. But he and the two females never reproduced.Dr. Steve Ngulu, the veterinarian who was in charge of Sudan, said the animal's death is sad and shocking — and a testament to human failure.""But then, as far as their propagation is concerned, we are happy that at least we collected some sperm from him and the other males,"" Ngulu said.One of the huge hurdles facing scientists is that the two remaining female northern white rhinos cannot gestate the next generation — one is sterile and the other is not physically capable of carrying a calf full term.""So, natural reproduction cannot take place, artificial insemination is not possible, so the only other option that we have to have a pure northern white rhino baby is to retrieve or to do something we call ovum pick-up, collect eggs from the females,"" Ngulu said.Those fert ilized eggs would then be implanted in a southern white rhino, who would carry the calf to term. Taking eggs from a rhino, though, has never been done. If and when scientists take that risk, there's a chance that the females could perish — bringing the species to extinction.",KENYA SOUTH AFRICA Králové Zoo SUDAN Fatu Joseph Thaida Dvůr Králové UGANDA Central Najin CZECH REPUBLIC Northern,"United Kingdom | World's last male northern white rhino dies as species faces extinction | http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/rhino-last-northern-white-male-dies-kenya-sudan-extinction-endangered-species-wild-animals-a8264351.html |  The world's last male northern white rhino, Sudan, has died after “age-related complications” in Kenya, conservationists looking after his care have announced. A statement from the Ol Pejeta Conservancy where Sudan lived said the 45-year-old rhino, who was suffering from muscle and bone deterioration and extensive skin wounds, was euthanised on Monday after his condition “worsened significantly”, leaving him unable to stand. The rhino had spent two weeks in late February and early March lying in his pen due to discomfort from a deep wound on his right hind leg.He had been part of an ambitious effort to save the subspecies from extinction with the help of its two surviving females, 27-year-old Najin and 17-year-old Fatu.After all attempts at getting him to mate naturally failed, conservationists last year put Sudan on dating app Tinder, hoping to raise enough money to pay for a $9m (£6.4m) fertility treatment. Sudan had previously lived at the Dver Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic before being transported to Ol Pejeta where he lived with the last two females of his species.“He was a great ambassador for his species and will be remembered for the work he did to raise awareness globally of the plight facing not only rhinos, but also the many thousands of other species facing extinction as a result of unsustainable human activity,” said the conservancy's CEO Richard Vigne. Sudan was something of a celebrity in his lifetime and attracted thousands of visitors to Dver Kralove and Ol Pejeta.",KENYA Dver Kralove CEO Richard Richard Vigne SUDAN CZECH REPUBLIC Kralove Zoo

In politics, the question is currently being discussed highly emotionally: Is Islam part of Germany? Already in 2010, former German President Christian Wulff (CDU) made it clear that for him the answer is ""yes"". Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) based his statement. But now the debate flares up again. When the new Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) contradicted the two in an interview: ""No. Islam does not belong to Germany. ""Germany is characterized by Christianity. However, he adds: ""The Muslims living with us are of course part of Germany."" Thus, the topic was set new - and was discussed in politics up and down. But how do the Germans stand to Seehofer's statement, ""Islam does not belong to Germany, but only the Muslims living here? ""More than three quarters of Germans (76 percent in total) agree with the statement. ""Totally agree"" is with 61 percent thereby the most selected answer option. 15 percent opted for ""rather agree"". This is the result of the WELT-Trends, a representative survey conducted exclusively by the polling institute Civey on behalf of WELT. In contrast, 20 percent of the Germans disagree with Seehofer on the question. About every tenth German (11 percent) does not agree with Seehofer. Four percent are ""undecided."" In terms of sympathy for each party Seehofer gets a lot of encouragement from their own Rei 88 per cent of Union supporters agree with the statement, 70 per cent even ""completely"". Only followers of the FDP (91 percent) and the AfD (95 percent) Seehofer's statement gets even more approval. But the sympathizers of the SPD (51 percent) and the left (57 percent) agree to the statement by a majority. Only the followers of the Greens contradict Seehofer majority (57 percent). But even among the SPD supporters (43 percent) and the leftists (37 percent) are large camps that do not share his opinion. Significantly less are the CDU (10 percent), the FDP (5 percent) and the AfD (4 percent). Also the place of residence seems to shape the opinion of the people living there. People from very rural areas agree with Seehofer's statement much more frequently (79 percent) than people from cities (67 percent). Whether people live in the east or west of Germany makes little difference. In East Germany, 79 percent agree with the statement, in the West there are 76 percent .Mehrheit for Seehofer's statement can be found in all age groups. People between 40 and 49 are most likely to vote (82 percent), second to people over 65 (79 percent), third to 50 to 64 year olds and fourth to 30 to 39 year olds , The least agree with the 18- and 29-year-olds (65 percent), but also here is a clear majority. Here you can still participate in the survey: Note to Methodology: In this WORLD trend was the question: ""What do you think of the statement by Interior Minister Seehofer, Islam does not belong to Germany, but only the Muslims living here?"" The polling firm Civey took into account the responses of 5100 for the representative result Participants between 16 and 18 March 2018. The statistical error of the results is 2.5 percent.

The six politicians have now come to the conclusion that Syria as a safe According to the North Rhine-Westphalian Member of Parliament Christian Blex in Berlin on Monday. Jürgen Pohl, who was on the trip, points out in an interview with the MDR that Syria wants to rebuild its own country and asks the other states It was also explicitly pointed out that desertional young men can return and fall under amnesty. Mr. Pohl explains: ""You can not just sit here and say we do not do anything. Because the situation on the ground is such that there are actually only in some places disputes. ""The AfD now wants the federal government to communicate their results of the trip and put pressure, Jürgen Pohl says: Video: The MDR spoke to the deputy of the AfD , Jürgen PohlThe video also commented on how the trip was organized, with the AFD asking in the Syrian Embassy of Russia and experiencing that it was very easy to organize the trip. They were in Aleppo, Homs, Damascus and saw the will of the people Reconstruction.Jürgen Pohl declares that he has not promoted exchange with opposition groups on the spot or abroad. They talked to a lot of groups, especially the UNHCR does a good job - where they give lessons, for example. The Red Crescent also provided good help. It was ""undisputed that there are still fighting zones in Syria"". The group also saw areas that were not destroyed at all. Syria says it does not want or want to put an end to international terrorism. Violent offenders from more than 100 states were identified on site, explains Jürgen Pohl. Six years of war were enough. The AfD politicians wanted to inform themselves with their journey on their own information about the possibilities for a return of Syrian refugees in their war-ravaged homeland. AfD foreign affairs minister Armin-Paulus Hampel suggested that the federal government or the EU could ""financially"" influence Damascus. He said: ""I have no information about reports that there have been chemical weapons operations by the Syrian government.

Had with the immigration of Turks and other Orientals in Germany Muslims came here and these now belong to our country, is not a question, as far as they are not in quasi But does the existence of Muslims in this country mean that Islam belongs to Germany, as the first Federal President, Christian Wulff, asserted in 2010? That was already the view of the Union parties - and not only there - many different: people he Kauder, head of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group, as well as the former Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich, for example, claimed the opposite and justified this - in the same sense as Seehofer - with the fact that Islam did not have influenced the traditions and identity of this country.Angela Merkel, who as chancellor had made her a master in weighing up, was probably trying to balance positions when she ambiguously suggested that Islam belonged to Germany as well as Muslims living here, ""we"" ( !), however, are ""based on the Christian-Jewish traditions."" Who are ""we"" and who are the Muslims who belong to this country, but apparently not with ""us"" because they stand on a different foundation? Chancellor and CDU chairman met, of course, with their attempt to balance vivid contradiction, especially since it is not only about the question of whether Islam is associated, but also whether or to what extent he should belong. Which Islam would be meant, wanted about Merkel's party colleague Wolfgang Bosbach know and asked if Islamist or even Salafist currents and Sharia should also belong to Germany. Still in the same direction, the Egyptian-born political scientist and former Muslim Brother Hamed Abdel-Samad went in an open letter to the Chancellor and demanded explain them to the citizens what Islam is, instead of just stating its affiliation. An explanation is The Chancellor had been as guilty as before, as well as an answer to the question of what she wanted to do against Islamization. When asked about it, she could not think of much more than to fool that many people who were afraid of Koran disbelief from Muslims , would not be bible itself. And Margot Käßmann, a trained pastor, wanted to take even worried Christians into prayer: Those who were ""afraid of full mosques"" would have to ""provide for full churches."" But church attendance and prayer would not have the Christians in the Middle East Hamed Abdel-Samad sneered at the two ""undisguised women"" - Merkel and Käßman. With the destabilization of state order in Iraq and Syria, Christianity, which has been part of the country for 2000 years, was largely helpless at the mercy of Muslim extremist terror. Many Christians from there, who sought protection here, as well as Yazidi suffered violence in some refugee housing by Muslims who had also made their way to us. Refugees who wanted to carry out religious conflicts in their countries of origin did not belong to us Hereby, said Aiman ​​Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. He probably wanted to meet the widespread and legitimate concern that with the refugee masses from the Orient increasingly extremists could haunt our country. Extremism would have nothing to do with Islam, one hears mantra-like from the mouth of Muslim representatives and party representatives, when extremists, referring to Islamic laws scorching and murdering moved through the country. ""Islam means peace,"" it says softly from the mouth of nice as well as obscure headscarves who in some places on the day of the open mosque greet the guests with flowers, as observed in mosque visits on the day as well as the reaction of many guests who nod in such a well-intentioned peace agreement and smile as if they were alms refuses to learn this from a vocation and, to that extent, does not have to fear that opponents of Islam might be right in their warnings; for a fear of this kind is just as symptomatic of Islamophobia as the fear of those for whom peace in the name of Islam is nothing more than a synonym for submission and for whom an Islamization of Europe would be equivalent to the fall of the West. No matter what such fears must hold It may be absurd to assert on the one hand that Islam belongs to Germany, but on the other hand to denounce Islamization. How else could a membership of Islam have arisen if there had not been a development that led to it and the name Islamization quite true? For this does not mean just conversion or even submission, but also a territorial spread of Islam, which is logically followed with the mass immigration of Muslims, unless the immigrants have given up their religious customs.Perhaps, those who are open to this question publicly Report words, not be so obtuse, but first think about what can be understood by ""belonging"" everything.

Maybe our country is not ready for that, it’s possible, it’s possible.” Trump said “personally I can’t understand that” about those opposed to such drastic measures.Some states already charge drug dealers with murder if customers overdose. In Florida, people who provide cocaine, heroin or the powerful opioid fentanyl to a person who dies from using the drug in question can be charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to either life in prison or death.Drug-induced homicide laws, which emerged in the 1980s, are being used more frequently because of the opioids crisis, according to a November 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance. However, there is no evidence that such laws reduce drug use.On Monday Trump was effectively sending a message to prosecutors to be harsher on drug dealers, who traffic in street drugs like heroin as well as black market prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, and various versions of the potent narcotic fentanyl. But he did not call specifically for legislation to expand use of the death penalty for federal drug crimes.The justice department said the federa l death penalty is already available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law.The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, attended the event on Monday and sat next to Melania Trump. The DoJ later issued a statement, saying: “At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.”Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear federal death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the supreme court.New Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: “We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – [it] is coming from the southern border.”The comment caused offence in the state, with the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan responding: “Instead of insulting people in the throes of addiction, [Trump] needs to work across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis.”Though Trump is visiting to lobby for harsher sentencing for opioid-relat ed crimes, New Hampshire is one of many states now pushing criminal justice reform.On Monday, the state judiciary announced it would review bail policies, after nationwide criticism of courts that serve as de facto debtor’s prisons for people too poor to pay bail.In 2012, substance use disorders such as opioid dependence cost New Hampshire $284m in criminal justice costs. More than half of jail and prison costs in the state are attributed to drug abuse, according to a report by the advocacy group New Futures. Nationally, 76% of inmates are believed to have substance use disorders, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has repeatedly highlighted his preference for the “ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.At a Pennsylvania rally this month, Trump told supporters countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.“The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” Trump said in remarks he echoed on Monday.Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump’s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the White House plan.T he president was joined in New Hampshire by the first lady, Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.Trump’s plan concerns law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. It also includes broadening education and awareness, expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts and government funding for efforts to develop non-addictive painkillers. He also said that the Department of Justice was “looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies.” Leading opioids makers in the US are already engulfed in a flurry of civil litigation brought by cities, counties and states.Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We call it the crisis next door because everyone knows someone,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser. “This is no longer somebody else’s community, somebody else’s kid, somebody else’s co-worker.”",OxyContin Congress Donald Trump York Statistics UNITED STATES New Hampshire Ohio State Drug Futures Melania Florida Bureau Policy Alliance Kellyanne Conway Doug Berman Chicago SINGAPORE Andrew Bremberg State University Jeff Sessions Los Angeles Maggie Hassan Justice

Those involved in the feud, which centres around the Velt server operators, reportedly claimed their opponents engaged in illegal activities to harass each other. An unverified image on social media claims to show the email sent to schools saying: “The bomb is set to go off in 3 hours time if you do not send $5,000.""It adds: “If you do not sent the money we will blow up the device.“If you try to call the cops we WILL blow up the device on the SPOT. ANY attempt at defusing it your self will cause it to explode.”Cardinal Road School in Feltham, Hounslow, is one of the schools evacuated in London.Schools in Stevenage, Watford, St Albans, Hemel Hempstead and Hertford have also received bomb threats.The Valley School in Stevenage decided to evacuate the pupils after receiving a bomb threat this morning.Hertfordshire police said: “We did not advise any schools ourselves to evacuate but The Valley School in Stevenage made the decision to evacuate and we sent officers to as sist them.”Carson Kallen, chief executive of VELT, the Michigan-based company that runs VeltPvP, told The Telegraph that they believe the email was set from ""a group of hackers”.""Please collect your child as soon as possible.""Schools in Chiswick, Ilford and Lambeth in the capital have also been evacuated.A Hounslow Council spokesman said: “Several schools are affected in Hounslow.""Initially we thought it was isolated to one school. But there are eight to date in Hounslow that we are aware of. I can’t say if they have all been evacuated.“We are monitoring the situation very closely, and working with the police and taking our lead from them. “Schools have their own protocol in place and its up to them how they respond.”Our Lady Immaculate Catholic Primary school in Tolworth was also affected.The threats are being treated as a mass hoax.Orthodox Judaism comprehensive school the Kantor King Solomon, in Barkingside, east London tweeted: “There was a national threat made to lots of schools this morning and KKS went into evacuation to ensure the safety of our site.“This was in conjunction with CST and the Metropolitan Police.“We have established that there is no further threat and School is now running as normal.”A group of Putin-sympathisers was behind a similar series of bomb threats to schools across the UK and France in 2016.The group named ‘Evacuators 2K16’, which used a Russian email address ending in the domain ‘.ru’ said on Twitter they were behind the threats which targeted 14 schools in Britain and six in France.Its Twitter account said it supported the Assad regime in Syria. It told children to contact them if they wanted to “get out of school”.In Yorkshire, police said it had sent its Cybercrime Unit Detectives to look at the emails, and said “it is not believed there is any genuine threat”.The Met Police said eight schools were emailed in Hounslow, but it was up to the schools, not police, whether to evacuate.In Humberside, 12 schools have told police they have received the email, and have been told not to evacuate.Dowdales Secondary School in Dalton, Cumbria evacuated pupils as a precaution.Lakes College in Workington and North Lakes Primary School in Penrith also received the bomb threat in Cumbria.At least 35 schools have been affected in Northumbria, while nine were sent the threats in Lincolnshire.A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ""We have received reports from a large number of schools in our region they they have received threatening emails.""The emails inform the school that a bomb has been placed on the grounds and will be detonated if they don't hand over cash.""Detectives have looked into the emails, which appear to originate from the US, and can confirm there is no viable threat.""Schools have been visited by police to reassure them that the incident is being treated as a hoax and address any concerns.""We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and an investigation into the emails in question is underway.""A stateme nt from the Met Police said: “Police are investigating reports of communications made to a number of schools across London today, Monday, 19 March.“There have been no arrests.

Eastern GERMANY,"Germany | Große Koalition: Festhalten! Rechtskurve! | http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/grosse-koalition-kaum-im-amt-blinkt-sie-schon-nach-rechts-kolumne-a-1198779.html |  ""Haut'se, haut'se, always on the muzzle!"" This is a motto that has so far not been associated with Angela Merkel's style of politics. Nevertheless, the fourth cabinet of the Chancellor takes up his work with unfamiliar roughness. Islam, poverty, abortion - the new government was barely in office and immediately ignited a firework of right-wing blast. Or is this a sign of Merkel's loss of control? Or the expression of a general mood, which - in a modification of a famous presidential statement - has the one demand: through Germany, a shift to the right! Horst Seehofer and Jens Spahn have in the Cabinet Merkel IV the role of conservative bang batches. Within a few days, one has expatriated Islam from Germany and the other only insulted Hartz IV recipients as crybabies and then compensated for abortions against animal welfare. Politics of the center is different. But who says that this government will make a policy of the middle? It is part of the essence of the Union to represent mostly the so-called healthy sense of the people. And right now, that's right. On the internet, you can read a ""2018 statement,"" which reads: ""We are watching with increasing consternation how Germany is damaged by illegal mass immigration, and we are solidarizing ourselves with those who peacefully demonstrate for it that the rule of law is restored at the borders of our country. "" These people talk about the law aat - in truth, they want the Rechtsruck.Vornweg run the usual suspects - Sarrazin, Broder, Lengsfeld -, followed by a lot of AfD sympathizers and other brown socks. And then there are all the angry professors and doctorses, the sour creme de la creme of the worried German bourgeoisie. They can not assert any extenuating circumstances for themselves - heavy Eastern childhood, fear of globalization or something - they know exactly what they are doing: they want pure Germany. And Horst Seehofer also knows what he does when he gives sugar to such people. ""Islam does not belong to Germany"" - the sentence was deliberately unclear because its meaning is completely different, depending on whether one understands it normatively or descriptively. Seehofer knows that, of course. But he does not care. In Bavaria is campaigning, Markus Söder had his first day in the State Chancellery - two good reasons to let out the Horst. And when it comes to Muslims, applies not only in Munich, the old sentence of Monaco Franze: A little bit what is always. But not the Muslims are the problem, but the potato Germans. Unfortunately, quite a few are grumpy, anxious, spoiled and haughty - and the dull-cheeked populism comes along, the greater is his chance of success with these people. Horst Seehofer's zenith as a populist is already behind him - but Jens Spahn still has his own. His comments on Hartz IV - is not poverty, one comes super with clear - could perhaps still be recorded as a typical cold-blooded capitalist sinism with which the better-off people have always looked down on the poor. However, what he said in the debate on paragraph 219a went one step further: ""When it comes to the lives of animals, some who now want to promote abortions are uncompromising, but sometimes there is not much going on in this debate considers that it is about unborn human life. ""Who is campaigning for abortion? What is Spahn talking about? Advertising for abortion would be for example: ""Abortion: the best thing about the North."" Or: ""Abortion ... I like it!"" Maybe also: ""losing weight without sports."" Or just like in the L'Tur advertisement: ""Nix wie weg!"" But the new health minister should know that the discussion is not about advertising, but about information. Of course he knows that. Right-wing populists always sell their audiences more stupid than they are themselves. When rights talk: like bookseller Heinz Ostermann of Terror Hartz IV: Black-Red is supposed to be a coalition of small people. Ulrike Winkelmann has her doubts there

They want to pull the coat over her ears and distribute it among themselves, even before she can say ""Peter Altmaier"". We are to blame ourselves. We left power in the hands of a chancellor who is only on call. But with the power it is just the same: once its end is in sight, it is in fact already achieved.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT. In this connection, he believes that the Ukrainian minister is only trying to warm up interest in his country.",Dmitry Abzalov Merkel UNITED STATES Pavel Klimkin LATVIA Trojan UKRAINE Bild Schröder Despite Strategic Communications Timothy Bordachev WSJ RUSSIA Gerhard Schroeder Wall Street Street Journal Rosneft GERMANY Nord Stream Eastern ESTONIA Middle East

Gatzer had left the Ministry until the end of last year to hire at the Deutsche Bahn. Even more spectacular is the second persona: Jörg Kukies, previously co-head of Germany at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, should take care of a state official for international financial architecture. The Germany Head of the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs joins the Federal Ministry of Finance as a State Secretary. Kukies has been at the helm of Goldman Sachs in Germany since 2014. He has been working for the US investment bank in London and Frankfurt since 2001. Investment banker in the lead of a SPD ministry Kukies has been a member of the SPD for many years and as predecessor of Andrea Nahles was Juso's boss in Rhineland-Palatinate. Nevertheless, an investment banker in the head of a SPD ministry is at least unusual. From the economic wing of the SPD there was praise for the decision: It was ""brilliant to get a Secretary of State with proven international expertise,"" said Harald Christ, treasurer of the SPD On the other hand, there may also be reservations about a Goldman Sachs man in government. In the US, the switch from investment bank to ministry has a long tradition. Also, the current US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchi He once worked for Goldman. Kukies is a recognized connoisseur of the financial markets - and one of the best-earning bank managers in Germany. He will have to exchange his millions in salary for a State Secretary salary, which is around 160,000 euros per year, without surcharges.From the train back to the ministryAlso the second state secretary in Scholz Ministry comes from the economy: Werner Gatzer had only at the beginning of the year Deutsche Bahn started as head of DB Station & Service. The 59-year-old was already from 2005 to 2017 finance secretary of state and responsible for the budget. Gatzer served - which rarely happens - ministers of different parties, first Peer Steinbrück (SPD), then Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU). This was proof of his expertise. Because of the long formation of a government, there is considerable time pressure in the preparation of a new budget, which is to be adopted by the Bundestag and Bundesrat by July. The new ministers are likely to try to implement many projects of the coalition agreement - it is important to keep the financial scope in view.

All information in the news ticker of FOCUS Online.14.17: Berlin - Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) supports the initiative of Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) for longer border controls. ""The Chancellor and the Interior Minister have agreed that an extension of the controls at the German border is currently necessary,"" said government spokesman Steffen Seibert on Monday in Berlin. Seehofer had called in the ""World on Sunday"", the European internal borders would have to be monitored until the external borders were protected, and also increased surveillance of internal borders brought into play. Germany had in September Started inspections in 2015 in view of the strong influx of refugees on the border with Austria. The controls take place on three cross-border highways and changing locations in the border area. In the so-called ""veiling investigation"", police officers can also check travelers without specific suspicion. According to the Ministry of the Interior, 16,000 unauthorized immigrants were picked up last year. 7,000 people were therefore rejected because they did not have a right of residence or a valid travel document or did not seek protection in Germany. In the vicinity of the Czech border, according to the ministry, the authorities registered 4,053 persons to whom they were subject to unauthorized entry, at the French border there were 3946 people, near Poland 2148, Monday, March 19, 11:31: The head of the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, Jörg Kukies, changes as a state secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance.

Kukies has been co-chairman of Goldman Sachs in Germany since 2014. He has been working for the US investment bank in London and Frankfurt am Main since 2001. Goldman Sachs managers in politics are not uncommon, especially in the US. US President Donald Trump had temporarily appointed five different senior executives to the bank, including the current Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin. Even Trump's predecessor Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had appointed former Goldman Sachs managers to finance ministers.

People RUSSIA,"Germany | Türkischer Einmarsch in Afrin: Erdogans vergifteter Triumph | http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/tuerkei-fuer-recep-tayyip-erdogan-fangen-die-probleme-in-afrin-erst-an-a-1198817.html |  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claims his military liberate the Turkish-Syrian border area from terrorists. But on the people of the city of Afrin, in north-western Syria, Turkey's invasion on Sunday must have been like the appearance of an occupying power. Turkish soldiers hoisted the flag of their country over buildings of the administration. Their allies from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) plundered food, electrical appliances, motorcycles, goats, set fire to shops selling alcohol. Fighters drove forward with bulldozers and tore the statue of blacksmith Kawa, a Kurdish legend figure, from the pedestal. For Erdogan the conquest of Afrin means a military success. His army marched into the province of Afrin on January 20 to fight the Kurdish militia YPG. Piece by piece, the soldiers had moved from the border to the center of the province. Since the beginning of last week, they besieged the city of Afrin. Observers had forecast weeks, possibly months, of battles. Ultimately, however, the YPG retreated, with almost no resistance. ""The terrorists ran away with their tails tucked in,"" Erdogan mocked. Turkey has also defeated the world powers USA and Russia in Afrin, added one of its advisors. Government-run Turkish newspapers wrote on Monday about a ""Victory Day"" and a ""Day of Pride."" ""We wrote history in Afrin."" And even opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu spoke of a ""heroic battle"". ""Human lives count nothing"" For the majority of people in Afrin, however, the fall of their hometown is a disaster. Afrin was one of the few regions in Syria that had been largely spared the horror of the civil war so far. Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens, Yazidis found refuge here and lived side by side in a largely peaceful way. Tens of thousands are now on the run. People have to watch their homes being looted and do not know when and under what circumstances they can return. ""Here in Syria everyone has their own war,"" said a resident of Afrin Der Spiegel. ""Human lives count for nothing."" Erdogan is likely to feel affirmed in his war policy by defeating the YPG in Afrin. He sees the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdish terrorist organization PKK and has already announced that they want to pursue the militia to the border with Iraq. His government is currently negotiating with the US for a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from Manbij, a city east of Afrin. Turkish soldiers in Afrin respond to a journalist's question about their goals: ""Manbij, Aleppo, Kandil"" (PKK Headquarters). In the medium term, however, the military could take revenge on Turkey. Although Erdogan is self-confident: ""In the center of Afrin now the symbols of confidence and stability are blowing - and not the rags and terrorists,"" he said. But his Rhe Torik can not hide the fact that his government has no plan for a post-war order. It is easier to invade a country than to come out again. Erdogan calls the city of Jabulusul, the place that the Turkish soldiers co-operated with FSA a year and a half ago, as a blueprint for Afrin Fighters from the ""Islamic State"" and has been administered by Turkey ever since. But both cities can hardly be compared. Most of the Arabs live in Jabulus, who welcomed the Turkish soldiers and the FSA as a protective power. The Kurds in Afrin, on the other hand, regard Turkey as an intruder. Although not all residents of the city support the YPG yet, they are unlikely to accept a Turkish occupation without resistance.Othman Sheikh Issa, the deputy head of the Kurdish administration in Afrin, is threatening a guerrilla war: ""Our troops are in the entire vicinity of Afrin These troops will fight the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries wherever possible. ""Video: Tanks Roll into the Center of AfrinErdogan now has two options in Afrin: he can forcibly consolidate his rule over the city. He would have to permanently station a large number of Turkish soldiers and police in Afrin, who would be exposed to the constant danger of attacks and uprisings. Or Turkey leaves the city to the regime of Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad. For Erdogan, that would be a blah mage. He condemned Assad as a terrorist and perpetrated his fall. Citizens in Turkey would hardly understand why Turkish soldiers had to die for Assad. The Turkish president could soon have a similar experience in Syria as his former American counterpart George W.

""The terrorists ran away with their tails tucked in,"" Erdogan mocked. Turkey has also defeated the world powers USA and Russia in Afrin, added one of its advisors. Government-run Turkish newspapers wrote on Monday about a ""Victory Day"" and a ""Day of Pride."" ""We wrote history in Afrin."" And even opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu spoke of a ""heroic battle"". ""Human lives count nothing"" For the majority of people in Afrin, however, the fall of their hometown is a disaster. Afrin was one of the few regions in Syria that had been largely spared the horror of the civil war so far. Kurds, Arabs, Turkmens, Yazidis found refuge here and lived side by side in a largely peaceful way. Tens of thousands are now on the run. People have to watch their homes being looted and do not know when and under what circumstances they can return. ""Here in Syria everyone has their own war,"" said a resident of Afrin Der Spiegel. ""Human lives count for nothing."" Erdogan is likely to feel affirmed in his war policy by defeating the YPG in Afrin. He sees the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdish terrorist organization PKK and has already announced that they want to pursue the militia to the border with Iraq. His government is currently negotiating with the US for a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from Manbij, a city east of Afrin. Turkish soldiers in Afrin respond to a journalist's question about their goals: ""Manbij, Aleppo, Kandil"" (PKK Headquarters). In the medium term, however, the military could take revenge on Turkey. Although Erdogan is self-confident: ""In the center of Afrin now the symbols of confidence and stability are blowing - and not the rags and terrorists,"" he said. But his Rhe Torik can not hide the fact that his government has no plan for a post-war order. It is easier to invade a country than to come out again. Erdogan calls the city of Jabulusul, the place that the Turkish soldiers co-operated with FSA a year and a half ago, as a blueprint for Afrin Fighters from the ""Islamic State"" and has been administered by Turkey ever since. But both cities can hardly be compared. Most of the Arabs live in Jabulus, who welcomed the Turkish soldiers and the FSA as a protective power. The Kurds in Afrin, on the other hand, regard Turkey as an intruder. Although not all residents of the city support the YPG yet, they are unlikely to accept a Turkish occupation without resistance.Othman Sheikh Issa, the deputy head of the Kurdish administration in Afrin, is threatening a guerrilla war: ""Our troops are in the entire vicinity of Afrin These troops will fight the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries wherever possible. ""Video: Tanks Roll into the Center of AfrinErdogan now has two options in Afrin: he can forcibly consolidate his rule over the city. He would have to permanently station a large number of Turkish soldiers and police in Afrin, who would be exposed to the constant danger of attacks and uprisings. Or Turkey leaves the city to the regime of Syria's dictator Bashar al-Assad. For Erdogan, that would be a blah mage. He condemned Assad as a terrorist and perpetrated his fall. Citizens in Turkey would hardly understand why Turkish soldiers had to die for Assad. The Turkish president could soon have a similar experience in Syria as his former American counterpart George W.

Hello! This is Sergey, the editor. For a long time I watched Varlamov postulate his theses about the benefits of elections in Russia, but even my patience comes to an end.

No more strength to listen to this nonsense ... Maybe we will discuss?



1. You can not go to elections

Here everything is simple. If you are against the regime, but go to the polls, then you automatically contribute to its legitimization. If you are against Putin, but go to the polls, then you are for Putin. In today's Russia, the only adequate and only visible way to state your protest is to completely ignore the electoral system.

You are aware that without throwing in will not do. You know that, perhaps, the main opposition politician in the country is not allowed before the elections on artificial grounds. On your eyes, the regime in the most fantastic ways tries to increase the turnout, so that more sheep come to the slaughterhouse from the free pastures. But you still drag yourself to the site to pay your respects to Mr. Putin.

Remember: if you urge to go to the polls without fail to ""express your opinion"", then you are a man harmful to Russia. As harmful as any system manager from EdRa.

""Go on dick, beaver collar, I'm not going to play by your rules!"" - that's what you have to say.

Here an impatient reader, a dashing quilted jacket or a ""permitted"" apple-type liberal already wants to accuse me of sympathy for Navalny, but he is disappointed. I have no sympathy for Navalny. It was once, in 2009-2010, but it all came out.

The fact is that in the talent those instantly change their shoes Navalny is like a 9th grade student, at a rush to a kiosk for beer and cigarettes, but still unable to overcome the checkpoint on duty without a change.

In December 2011, Navalny shouted into the microphone that the Kremlin can be taken even now. In August 2013, he willingly used the signatures of ""EdRa"" to run for the post of the mayor of Moscow. Now that he was not allowed to vote before the elections, Navalny immediately made a poker deal and said that the election is, it turns out, full of bullshit, and all of us were dragged bad cats by the nose!

In short, this way: I am very grateful to the UVP of the Administration of the President of Russia for instructing Mr. Navalny and his supporters on the true path. So we will win!



Those who constantly go to the polls and then beleaguered polls from polling stations should ask themselves one simple question: what good happened in the political life of Russia in the past 6 and a half years?

Well, at first, the Moscow opposition tusovka moved from ""Jean-Jacques"" to Telegram (and some also abroad). This is the main achievement, I believe. Prisoners of Marsh went out of prison. Someone received fresh grants. The site ""Mediason"" (I'm serious this time: this is really very important and very useful). Katz and Gudkov conducted a municipal campaign, and then - you will not believe it! - razosralis ... And that defended the independent mundepy Moscow trolleybus or green blocks of Khrushchev? Ah ha ha ha ha!

A significant victory, in fact, was only one - the advent of Roizma on to Ekaterinburg. But it, as I understand it, some kind of concession to the authorities personally Prokhorov, and not you. In addition, Roizman was a political freak even by the standards of the opposition.

Nemtsov was killed. The system makers of Ulyukaev and Belykh are sitting. Semisystemist Urlashov is sitting. If even one more independent mayor or governor is elected, he will be imprisoned too. How do you like this situation, dear fans of campaigns for elections? Is this an honest game, or was the bottle neck just anatomical enough?


2. Putin's interest is not an invention of the Kremlin

Yes, here I agree with Varlamov. The blatant screams of demshiz that Putin does not enjoy popular support is some kind of enchanting delirium.

When the leader, pumped up with propaganda, gives the illusion of power and greatness to a humiliated (even if supposedly humiliated) country, this always brings fruit. This was the case when Hitler was building the ideology of his state on the basis of hatred of internal and external enemies. The masses applauded him when he seized Austria and tore Czechoslovakia apart. Europe was shaking and was unable to intervene ...

Does not it look like anything?


3. Russia is ruled by grandmothers

The core of Putin's electorate is women over 45 years old. The most fat layer of those who vote for Putin is a grandmother from the age of 60. Who sit at home, do nothing, watch television, enjoy the success of the country listed in the program ""Time"", and they want you all to live in shit.

Is it possible to change this statistics or somehow draw it to your advantage? Not sure. And in general, how much Putin can a country still swallow?

Kaza The dependence should be very simple: the worse the people live, the weaker the position of the government. But this is all nonsense. The historical experience of Russia (Ivan IV, Stalin - yes anyone) and the life of some modern states (DPRK, Venezuela, African dictatorships) clearly demonstrates that peoples are subject to the Stockholm syndrome no worse than individuals. This means that Russia will accept Putin until one of the two elements disappears: either Putin or Russia. Or maybe both.

And then I turn to the last point.


4. Salvation of drowning people - not business

So, the Russians have made their choice. For the next 20 years, a noble cross between the Politburo and the State Emergency Committee will rule the country. The other day you will for sure reveal the secret of stability and continuity of the process of getting up from your knees.

But since Russia is a country of forestry, when you cut a forest, you will surely fly to a well-groomed person. And there are some points to which you will have to take your understanding:

If suddenly it turns out that the cops shoved your child into a ""bobik"", taken to the police station and tortured all night with an electric shock, do not be too surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your mother has cancer, but you can not get painkillers for her, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your uncle was summoned from the reserve and sent off to fight somewhere, and there he was cut off his head, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your sister was carried away by feminism, and her brave Cossacks whipped her for this, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly ok It seems that your dog was knocked down by a buoyant judge on his BMW, and then you had to pay for the repair of his car, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that your business was squeezed out by an ethnic organized crime group, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the Kremlin was demolished, in order to build a shopping mall and an elite 40-story LCD, instead of it, do not be surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that a park was cut down next to your house and a temple and a junction built in its place, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that there is no longer a trolley and a tram in your city, although it has always been (even in the ""dashing 90s""), do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the road surface in your city has eroded to the mantle of the Earth, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your street was flooded with the blood of sacrificial rams, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 5,000 people were killed at the plant of your monotown, and then they closed the enterprise altogether, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that you can not go to Turkey or Egypt, because it requires an exit visa, which is given only to spies and artists of the Bolshoi Theater, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that all the decent products from the stores have disappeared, and instead of them there is a ""plastic porridge"" on the shelves, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that you were given a hectare of land in the Far East, and then the Ministry of Defense, FSO or the FSB seized it for their own needs, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your cottage has collapsed full th Heptyla Proton-M rocket with another satellite, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 30 years have passed, and no Russia is already there, do not be very surprised.

But on the people of the city of Afrin, in north-western Syria, Turkey's invasion on Sunday must have been like the appearance of an occupying power. Turkish soldiers hoisted the flag of their country over buildings of the administration. Their allies from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) plundered food, electrical appliances, motorcycles, goats, set fire to shops selling alcohol. Fighters drove forward with bulldozers and tore the statue of blacksmith Kawa, a Kurdish legend figure, from the pedestal. For Erdogan the conquest of Afrin means a military success. His army marched into the province of Afrin on January 20 to fight the Kurdish militia YPG. Piece by piece, the soldiers had moved from the border to the center of the province.

Had with the immigration of Turks and other Orientals in Germany Muslims came here and these now belong to our country, is not a question, as far as they are not in quasi But does the existence of Muslims in this country mean that Islam belongs to Germany, as the first Federal President, Christian Wulff, asserted in 2010? That was already the view of the Union parties - and not only there - many different: people he Kauder, head of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group, as well as the former Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich, for example, claimed the opposite and justified this - in the same sense as Seehofer - with the fact that Islam did not have influenced the traditions and identity of this country.Angela Merkel, who as chancellor had made her a master in weighing up, was probably trying to balance positions when she ambiguously suggested that Islam belonged to Germany as well as Muslims living here, ""we"" ( !), however, are ""based on the Christian-Jewish traditions."" Who are ""we"" and who are the Muslims who belong to this country, but apparently not with ""us"" because they stand on a different foundation? Chancellor and CDU chairman met, of course, with their attempt to balance vivid contradiction, especially since it is not only about the question of whether Islam is associated, but also whether or to what extent he should belong. Which Islam would be meant, wanted about Merkel's party colleague Wolfgang Bosbach know and asked if Islamist or even Salafist currents and Sharia should also belong to Germany. Still in the same direction, the Egyptian-born political scientist and former Muslim Brother Hamed Abdel-Samad went in an open letter to the Chancellor and demanded explain them to the citizens what Islam is, instead of just stating its affiliation. An explanation is The Chancellor had been as guilty as before, as well as an answer to the question of what she wanted to do against Islamization. When asked about it, she could not think of much more than to fool that many people who were afraid of Koran disbelief from Muslims , would not be bible itself. And Margot Käßmann, a trained pastor, wanted to take even worried Christians into prayer: Those who were ""afraid of full mosques"" would have to ""provide for full churches."" But church attendance and prayer would not have the Christians in the Middle East Hamed Abdel-Samad sneered at the two ""undisguised women"" - Merkel and Käßman. With the destabilization of state order in Iraq and Syria, Christianity, which has been part of the country for 2000 years, was largely helpless at the mercy of Muslim extremist terror. Many Christians from there, who sought protection here, as well as Yazidi suffered violence in some refugee housing by Muslims who had also made their way to us. Refugees who wanted to carry out religious conflicts in their countries of origin did not belong to us Hereby, said Aiman ​​Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. He probably wanted to meet the widespread and legitimate concern that with the refugee masses from the Orient increasingly extremists could haunt our country. Extremism would have nothing to do with Islam, one hears mantra-like from the mouth of Muslim representatives and party representatives, when extremists, referring to Islamic laws scorching and murdering moved through the country. ""Islam means peace,"" it says softly from the mouth of nice as well as obscure headscarves who in some places on the day of the open mosque greet the guests with flowers, as observed in mosque visits on the day as well as the reaction of many guests who nod in such a well-intentioned peace agreement and smile as if they were alms refuses to learn this from a vocation and, to that extent, does not have to fear that opponents of Islam might be right in their warnings; for a fear of this kind is just as symptomatic of Islamophobia as the fear of those for whom peace in the name of Islam is nothing more than a synonym for submission and for whom an Islamization of Europe would be equivalent to the fall of the West. No matter what such fears must hold It may be absurd to assert on the one hand that Islam belongs to Germany, but on the other hand to denounce Islamization. How else could a membership of Islam have arisen if there had not been a development that led to it and the name Islamization quite true? For this does not mean just conversion or even submission, but also a territorial spread of Islam, which is logically followed with the mass immigration of Muslims, unless the immigrants have given up their religious customs.Perhaps, those who are open to this question publicly Report words, not be so obtuse, but first think about what can be understood by ""belonging"" everything.

In addition, the ""terrorist camps"" of the banned Kurdish Workers' Party PKK in northern Iraq will be ""under constant control if necessary"".

The PKK has its headquarters in the northern Iraqi Kandil mountains and also in the northern Iraqi Sinjar positions. Erdogan called Sinjar the ""second Kandil"" and said that Ankara has told the Iraqi central government that they should ""solve the matter"", otherwise Turkey will do. ""One night we would suddenly invade Sinjar and cleanse it from the PKK,"" Erdogan said. Meanwhile, activists and Kurds are accusing proturgical rebels of plundering their way into the city of Afrin.

They officially moved to Hartz IV. However, last wednesday, 14th of march, a family clan with south european roots was involved. A total of 70 private and business properties throughout Germany, bank deposit boxes, medical practices, offices and the ""Café M.C. - Multicultural Association for Integration and Communication ""at Leverkusen's main street, were searched. In particular, the raids concentrated on the cities of Neuss (18), Cologne (11) and Leverkusen (4). In Mettmann and Wuppertal eight objects each were searched. Further raids took place in Rhineland-Palatinate and even in Austria. Four men between 42 and 54 years were arrested, luxury vehicles, jewelry and cash secured. For a year, the authorities have investigated 43 people, including several tax accountants and a lawyer. One of the arrested is a 42-year-old man, Leverkusen clan chief and relevant pre-fined. He was arrested in his expensive multi-family dwelling. At around 7:00 pm, 15 police officials and seven bailiffs arrived with ladders on the property, overcame the walls, and opened the doors. The 42-year-old clan chief is officially a poor man who has been a sworn affidavit in the past Statement given n had and assured to own no fortune. Now the officials marveled but not bad, as the ""Express"" described: High-quality jewelry, cash, three Porsche and a licensed in Switzerland Rolls Royce ""Phantom"" were alone at this address ensured. Non-arrested family members had to leave the house and loud "" KStA ""seek refuge with"" other members of her widely ramified clan "". Due to the police action, a woman of the family fell into a great deal of anger and hurled a wooden meat thug after the numerous present media representatives. However, the poor family should have gone so bad despite the luxury that a large part of their social benefits related. Nevertheless, the son of the 42-year-old could get on his 18th birthday a Mercedes worth about 195,000 euros. The financing of the luxury life completed the family ties by ransacking of banks by real estate loans, social service providers and especially senior citizens throughout Germany. The damage is apparently several million euros. In the past, many of the clan members have already been convicted of commercial gang fraud to high prison sentences. In the past, the 42-year-old eldest son of the head of Leverkusen's extended family battled vigorously: as the fantasy name ""Sultan Salomon Ismail Minu-Mohamed Sultany-Ialla of Bahrain ""S he had already relieved a wealthy widow in Hamburg by 230,000 euros 12 years ago. The punishment of the district court of St. George was mild, one year and eight months imprisonment. The old lady (60) pretended the fraudulent ""Sultan"" before a financial plight, after he had previously ""enthralled them with love stinks,"" the ""Kölner Stadtanzeiger "". In a luxury hotel in Zurich, Switzerland, he made her a marriage proposal before he relieved her. At this time, wife and then four children in Leverkusen waiting for him. The 42-year-old is said to have recently gained the trust of a wealthy and elderly couple and also feigned an emergency. He captured around one million euros. And while the women of the Hartz IV family moved in, the family business executive bought real estate and luxury cars via straw men to wash the money. Besides the 42-year-old clan chief in Leverkusen, the three others Bosse (51, 52, 54) arrested in Bergisch Gladbach, Monheim am Rhein and Dortmund. In addition to the seven luxury cars worth around 800,000 euros, another 40,000 euros were secured in cash, valuable jewelry and real estate. In the process, arrest warrants were enforced against four suspects (42, 51, 52, 54).

That Could Change in 2018. | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html |  ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a state wide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new gene ration of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priorit y in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners , and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”",Warfare Congress Native Democrat Ms Ojibwe Minnesota Legislature Hawaii Indian Barack Obama Laguna Pueblo Health Service Trump Joe Monahan Mark Trahant Deb Haaland Republicans Healthcare National Massachusetts Sharon Clahchischilliage Albuquerque Denise Juneau Antoinette Sedillo Oklahoma MEXICO UNITED STATES Sedillo Lopez Party University Dakota Representatives Elizabeth Warren New MeToo ALBUQUERQUE House Hawaiian Peggy Flanagan Montana Andria Tupola

The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who put has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analy tica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, has done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” h e told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s t oo good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbu ll “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before th e information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.",IDs Channel Stephen Mark Turnbull Bannon Africa SCL Group UNITED STATES Zuckerberg York Times Alexander Nix Robert Mercer Cambridge Analytica House Commons News Stroz Friedberg Caribbean Berkeley Damian Collins RUSSIA Trump Observer Elections UNITED KINGDOM Parliament Elizabeth Denham New York Republican

She had no clinical record of any other diseases, other risk factors, [or] previous reactions of any kind,"" the paper explains.""During an api therapy session, she developed wheezing, dyspnea, and sudden loss of consciousness immediately after a live bee sting.""Although it might sound crazy that she had an allergic reaction after having the procedure so many times before, it's actually more plausible than you'd expect.As the paper mentions, repeated exposure to an allergen - in this case, bee venom - creates a greater risk of a severe allergic reaction than what can be expected in the normal population.The woman was rushed to hospital, and was given a number of compounds to try to stop the reaction, including adrenaline and antihistamines.Unfortunately, despite the treatment, the patient died in hospital from multiple organ failure some weeks later.It's really important to reiterate here that although it is growing in popularity, apitherapy shows very little evidence for being effective for any medical conditions, and this isn't even the first negative reaction to this type of therapy.In fact, a 2015 study published in PLOS One found that ""compared with normal saline injection, bee venom acupuncture showed a 261 percent increased relative risk for the occurrence of adverse events.""Plus, we really need bees doing our pollination right now, not being sacrificed for alternative medicine.Vazquez-Revuelta and Madrigal-Burgaleta's paper sums up nicely: ""the risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable.""We wholeheartedly agree.The paper has been published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology.",Wang Menglin University Hospital Vazquez Revuelta ITALY Madrigal Burgaleta SPAIN Ricardo Madrigal CHINA AUSTRALIA Korea Cajal University PLOS Paula Vazquez Ramon Broadcasting

In the background, more women with headscarf in a queue. Between them is also an elderly lady without a headscarf, she moves in the direction of the car. Many users see themselves confirmed in their prejudices: The ""foreigners"" German food was the food away, even though they themselves are not in need. The user, the shared more than 3000 responses, 32,000 times it was shared. ""Runs,"" he writes to the scene. In the comments he suggests that enrich foreigners who drive up in the Mercedes. His name is Marco Kurz and he advertises on his profile for populist ""Merkel must go"" demos and shares with preference reports of attacks by foreigners. A user points out that the picture does not explain anything: Why there is a Mercedes, whether the woman with a headscarf to the car - and if she visits the blackboard - is not apparent. When asked about it, Kurz says only: ""Why did nature give you eyes, ears and a brain?"" Meanwhile, several right-wing blogs have taken up the picture and spread the case further. For example, one page writes: The Landauer Tafel has heard about the dissemination and issued a statement. Thus, the context is wrong - the story behind the picture very different. The T afel writes: So it's about helpful neighbors - not about alleged beneficiaries of the Tafel.Die coworkers write further, everyone, who is needy, could receive with them food: It tries, with a video on Facebook the thing to ridicule. Short disguises himself with a headscarf and then seems to read a prepared text. He means that he never wanted to create the ""connection between a certain car brand, oriental clothing and the exploitation of our social system"" - others would have seen him. He accuses critics of hounding him and of lying to him. He calls them the ""biggest and stupid hypocrites in human history."" A clear correction does not express Kurz. He also does not explain his comments under the picture. Then he distracts: He accuses others of defending the Muslim woman in the picture but not having any ""charity"" for raped women. What the one should have to do with the other, he does not explain. The panels in Germany have been part of a larger debate for several weeks. In Essen, the institution had announced a stop to foreigners, because otherwise they could no longer meet the demand. Many observers have an understanding of the decision - foreigners were too much jostling. Others criticized the decision: How would needy people played against each other. Since my 30th Birthday I can no longer escape them, all the photos of big bellies and babies, terraced houses, second child and camper. Facebook and WhatsApp overflow and I had to realize: I found the great love, the right woman is by my side. Last year we got married, very romantic by the sea.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

TURKEY EGYPT,"Germany | Historiker fragt: ""Gehört der Islam zu Deutschland?"" | https://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/historiker-fragt-gehoert-der-islam-zu-deutschland-a2378407.html |  Hardly Horst Seehofer is in his office as the new Federal Interior Minister, he denies that Islam belongs to Germany, and thus triggers as expected knee-jerk contradictions of the Federal Chancellor and CDU chair Angela Merkel and also various representatives of other parties and associations - as if we have not had a debate on this question several times without understanding on a general language. Had with the immigration of Turks and other Orientals in Germany Muslims came here and these now belong to our country, is not a question, as far as they are not in quasi But does the existence of Muslims in this country mean that Islam belongs to Germany, as the first Federal President, Christian Wulff, asserted in 2010? That was already the view of the Union parties - and not only there - many different: people he Kauder, head of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group, as well as the former Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich, for example, claimed the opposite and justified this - in the same sense as Seehofer - with the fact that Islam did not have influenced the traditions and identity of this country.Angela Merkel, who as chancellor had made her a master in weighing up, was probably trying to balance positions when she ambiguously suggested that Islam belonged to Germany as well as Muslims living here, ""we"" ( !), however, are ""based on the Christian-Jewish traditions."" Who are ""we"" and who are the Muslims who belong to this country, but apparently not with ""us"" because they stand on a different foundation? Chancellor and CDU chairman met, of course, with their attempt to balance vivid contradiction, especially since it is not only about the question of whether Islam is associated, but also whether or to what extent he should belong. Which Islam would be meant, wanted about Merkel's party colleague Wolfgang Bosbach know and asked if Islamist or even Salafist currents and Sharia should also belong to Germany. Still in the same direction, the Egyptian-born political scientist and former Muslim Brother Hamed Abdel-Samad went in an open letter to the Chancellor and demanded explain them to the citizens what Islam is, instead of just stating its affiliation. An explanation is The Chancellor had been as guilty as before, as well as an answer to the question of what she wanted to do against Islamization. When asked about it, she could not think of much more than to fool that many people who were afraid of Koran disbelief from Muslims , would not be bible itself. And Margot Käßmann, a trained pastor, wanted to take even worried Christians into prayer: Those who were ""afraid of full mosques"" would have to ""provide for full churches."" But church attendance and prayer would not have the Christians in the Middle East Hamed Abdel-Samad sneered at the two ""undisguised women"" - Merkel and Käßman. With the destabilization of state order in Iraq and Syria, Christianity, which has been part of the country for 2000 years, was largely helpless at the mercy of Muslim extremist terror. Many Christians from there, who sought protection here, as well as Yazidi suffered violence in some refugee housing by Muslims who had also made their way to us. Refugees who wanted to carry out religious conflicts in their countries of origin did not belong to us Hereby, said Aiman ​​Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. He probably wanted to meet the widespread and legitimate concern that with the refugee masses from the Orient increasingly extremists could haunt our country. Extremism would have nothing to do with Islam, one hears mantra-like from the mouth of Muslim representatives and party representatives, when extremists, referring to Islamic laws scorching and murdering moved through the country. ""Islam means peace,"" it says softly from the mouth of nice as well as obscure headscarves who in some places on the day of the open mosque greet the guests with flowers, as observed in mosque visits on the day as well as the reaction of many guests who nod in such a well-intentioned peace agreement and smile as if they were alms refuses to learn this from a vocation and, to that extent, does not have to fear that opponents of Islam might be right in their warnings; for a fear of this kind is just as symptomatic of Islamophobia as the fear of those for whom peace in the name of Islam is nothing more than a synonym for submission and for whom an Islamization of Europe would be equivalent to the fall of the West. No matter what such fears must hold It may be absurd to assert on the one hand that Islam belongs to Germany, but on the other hand to denounce Islamization. How else could a membership of Islam have arisen if there had not been a development that led to it and the name Islamization quite true? For this does not mean just conversion or even submission, but also a territorial spread of Islam, which is logically followed with the mass immigration of Muslims, unless the immigrants have given up their religious customs.Perhaps, those who are open to this question publicly Report words, not be so obtuse, but first think about what can be understood by ""belonging"" everything.

Hello! This is Sergey, the editor. For a long time I watched Varlamov postulate his theses about the benefits of elections in Russia, but even my patience comes to an end.

No more strength to listen to this nonsense ... Maybe we will discuss?



1. You can not go to elections

Here everything is simple. If you are against the regime, but go to the polls, then you automatically contribute to its legitimization. If you are against Putin, but go to the polls, then you are for Putin. In today's Russia, the only adequate and only visible way to state your protest is to completely ignore the electoral system.

You are aware that without throwing in will not do. You know that, perhaps, the main opposition politician in the country is not allowed before the elections on artificial grounds. On your eyes, the regime in the most fantastic ways tries to increase the turnout, so that more sheep come to the slaughterhouse from the free pastures. But you still drag yourself to the site to pay your respects to Mr. Putin.

Remember: if you urge to go to the polls without fail to ""express your opinion"", then you are a man harmful to Russia. As harmful as any system manager from EdRa.

""Go on dick, beaver collar, I'm not going to play by your rules!"" - that's what you have to say.

Here an impatient reader, a dashing quilted jacket or a ""permitted"" apple-type liberal already wants to accuse me of sympathy for Navalny, but he is disappointed. I have no sympathy for Navalny. It was once, in 2009-2010, but it all came out.

The fact is that in the talent those instantly change their shoes Navalny is like a 9th grade student, at a rush to a kiosk for beer and cigarettes, but still unable to overcome the checkpoint on duty without a change.

In December 2011, Navalny shouted into the microphone that the Kremlin can be taken even now. In August 2013, he willingly used the signatures of ""EdRa"" to run for the post of the mayor of Moscow. Now that he was not allowed to vote before the elections, Navalny immediately made a poker deal and said that the election is, it turns out, full of bullshit, and all of us were dragged bad cats by the nose!

In short, this way: I am very grateful to the UVP of the Administration of the President of Russia for instructing Mr. Navalny and his supporters on the true path. So we will win!



Those who constantly go to the polls and then beleaguered polls from polling stations should ask themselves one simple question: what good happened in the political life of Russia in the past 6 and a half years?

Well, at first, the Moscow opposition tusovka moved from ""Jean-Jacques"" to Telegram (and some also abroad). This is the main achievement, I believe. Prisoners of Marsh went out of prison. Someone received fresh grants. The site ""Mediason"" (I'm serious this time: this is really very important and very useful). Katz and Gudkov conducted a municipal campaign, and then - you will not believe it! - razosralis ... And that defended the independent mundepy Moscow trolleybus or green blocks of Khrushchev? Ah ha ha ha ha!

A significant victory, in fact, was only one - the advent of Roizma on to Ekaterinburg. But it, as I understand it, some kind of concession to the authorities personally Prokhorov, and not you. In addition, Roizman was a political freak even by the standards of the opposition.

Nemtsov was killed. The system makers of Ulyukaev and Belykh are sitting. Semisystemist Urlashov is sitting. If even one more independent mayor or governor is elected, he will be imprisoned too. How do you like this situation, dear fans of campaigns for elections? Is this an honest game, or was the bottle neck just anatomical enough?


2. Putin's interest is not an invention of the Kremlin

Yes, here I agree with Varlamov. The blatant screams of demshiz that Putin does not enjoy popular support is some kind of enchanting delirium.

When the leader, pumped up with propaganda, gives the illusion of power and greatness to a humiliated (even if supposedly humiliated) country, this always brings fruit. This was the case when Hitler was building the ideology of his state on the basis of hatred of internal and external enemies. The masses applauded him when he seized Austria and tore Czechoslovakia apart. Europe was shaking and was unable to intervene ...

Does not it look like anything?


3. Russia is ruled by grandmothers

The core of Putin's electorate is women over 45 years old. The most fat layer of those who vote for Putin is a grandmother from the age of 60. Who sit at home, do nothing, watch television, enjoy the success of the country listed in the program ""Time"", and they want you all to live in shit.

Is it possible to change this statistics or somehow draw it to your advantage? Not sure. And in general, how much Putin can a country still swallow?

Kaza The dependence should be very simple: the worse the people live, the weaker the position of the government. But this is all nonsense. The historical experience of Russia (Ivan IV, Stalin - yes anyone) and the life of some modern states (DPRK, Venezuela, African dictatorships) clearly demonstrates that peoples are subject to the Stockholm syndrome no worse than individuals. This means that Russia will accept Putin until one of the two elements disappears: either Putin or Russia. Or maybe both.

And then I turn to the last point.


4. Salvation of drowning people - not business

So, the Russians have made their choice. For the next 20 years, a noble cross between the Politburo and the State Emergency Committee will rule the country. The other day you will for sure reveal the secret of stability and continuity of the process of getting up from your knees.

But since Russia is a country of forestry, when you cut a forest, you will surely fly to a well-groomed person. And there are some points to which you will have to take your understanding:

If suddenly it turns out that the cops shoved your child into a ""bobik"", taken to the police station and tortured all night with an electric shock, do not be too surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your mother has cancer, but you can not get painkillers for her, do not be so surprised.

GERMANY Middle East,"Germany | Historiker fragt: ""Gehört der Islam zu Deutschland?"" | https://www.epochtimes.de/politik/deutschland/historiker-fragt-gehoert-der-islam-zu-deutschland-a2378407.html |  Hardly Horst Seehofer is in his office as the new Federal Interior Minister, he denies that Islam belongs to Germany, and thus triggers as expected knee-jerk contradictions of the Federal Chancellor and CDU chair Angela Merkel and also various representatives of other parties and associations - as if we have not had a debate on this question several times without understanding on a general language. Had with the immigration of Turks and other Orientals in Germany Muslims came here and these now belong to our country, is not a question, as far as they are not in quasi But does the existence of Muslims in this country mean that Islam belongs to Germany, as the first Federal President, Christian Wulff, asserted in 2010? That was already the view of the Union parties - and not only there - many different: people he Kauder, head of the CDU / CSU parliamentary group, as well as the former Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich, for example, claimed the opposite and justified this - in the same sense as Seehofer - with the fact that Islam did not have influenced the traditions and identity of this country.Angela Merkel, who as chancellor had made her a master in weighing up, was probably trying to balance positions when she ambiguously suggested that Islam belonged to Germany as well as Muslims living here, ""we"" ( !), however, are ""based on the Christian-Jewish traditions."" Who are ""we"" and who are the Muslims who belong to this country, but apparently not with ""us"" because they stand on a different foundation? Chancellor and CDU chairman met, of course, with their attempt to balance vivid contradiction, especially since it is not only about the question of whether Islam is associated, but also whether or to what extent he should belong. Which Islam would be meant, wanted about Merkel's party colleague Wolfgang Bosbach know and asked if Islamist or even Salafist currents and Sharia should also belong to Germany. Still in the same direction, the Egyptian-born political scientist and former Muslim Brother Hamed Abdel-Samad went in an open letter to the Chancellor and demanded explain them to the citizens what Islam is, instead of just stating its affiliation. An explanation is The Chancellor had been as guilty as before, as well as an answer to the question of what she wanted to do against Islamization. When asked about it, she could not think of much more than to fool that many people who were afraid of Koran disbelief from Muslims , would not be bible itself. And Margot Käßmann, a trained pastor, wanted to take even worried Christians into prayer: Those who were ""afraid of full mosques"" would have to ""provide for full churches."" But church attendance and prayer would not have the Christians in the Middle East Hamed Abdel-Samad sneered at the two ""undisguised women"" - Merkel and Käßman. With the destabilization of state order in Iraq and Syria, Christianity, which has been part of the country for 2000 years, was largely helpless at the mercy of Muslim extremist terror. Many Christians from there, who sought protection here, as well as Yazidi suffered violence in some refugee housing by Muslims who had also made their way to us. Refugees who wanted to carry out religious conflicts in their countries of origin did not belong to us Hereby, said Aiman ​​Mazyek, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. He probably wanted to meet the widespread and legitimate concern that with the refugee masses from the Orient increasingly extremists could haunt our country. Extremism would have nothing to do with Islam, one hears mantra-like from the mouth of Muslim representatives and party representatives, when extremists, referring to Islamic laws scorching and murdering moved through the country. ""Islam means peace,"" it says softly from the mouth of nice as well as obscure headscarves who in some places on the day of the open mosque greet the guests with flowers, as observed in mosque visits on the day as well as the reaction of many guests who nod in such a well-intentioned peace agreement and smile as if they were alms refuses to learn this from a vocation and, to that extent, does not have to fear that opponents of Islam might be right in their warnings; for a fear of this kind is just as symptomatic of Islamophobia as the fear of those for whom peace in the name of Islam is nothing more than a synonym for submission and for whom an Islamization of Europe would be equivalent to the fall of the West. No matter what such fears must hold It may be absurd to assert on the one hand that Islam belongs to Germany, but on the other hand to denounce Islamization. How else could a membership of Islam have arisen if there had not been a development that led to it and the name Islamization quite true? For this does not mean just conversion or even submission, but also a territorial spread of Islam, which is logically followed with the mass immigration of Muslims, unless the immigrants have given up their religious customs.Perhaps, those who are open to this question publicly Report words, not be so obtuse, but first think about what can be understood by ""belonging"" everything.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,” White can be heard saying in the video, the Washington Post reported.“And D.C. keeps talking about, ‘We a resilient city,’” he continues. “And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.”The Rothschilds are a wealthy business dynasty descended from Mayer Amschel Rothschild, an 18th-century Jewish banker who lived in Frankfurt, Germany.Over the years, they’ve been the subject of wild anti-Semitic conspiracy theories accusing them and other Jewish people of secretly orchestrating world events to their advantage.“This kind of anti-Semitism is unacceptable in any public official. This so diminishes what America is about and adds to the oppressive feeling going on in the country right now,” Rabbi Daniel Zemel of Temple Micah in northwest Washington told the paper.On Sunday night, White posted a note on Twitter apologizing “to the Jewish community and anyone I have offended.”“The Jewish community have been allies w ith me in my journey to help people.

That Could Change in 2018. | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html |  ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a state wide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new gene ration of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priorit y in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners , and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”",Warfare Congress Native Democrat Ms Ojibwe Minnesota Legislature Hawaii Indian Barack Obama Laguna Pueblo Health Service Trump Joe Monahan Mark Trahant Deb Haaland Republicans Healthcare National Massachusetts Sharon Clahchischilliage Albuquerque Denise Juneau Antoinette Sedillo Oklahoma MEXICO UNITED STATES Sedillo Lopez Party University Dakota Representatives Elizabeth Warren New MeToo ALBUQUERQUE House Hawaiian Peggy Flanagan Montana Andria Tupola

One of them: Borussia Dortmund BVB shows very specific interest in the 1.75-meter Argentine attackers, which many would like to see in his homeland at the 2018 World Cup, although he is still without an A-international match. He is the favorite for the long-term succession of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. According to information from Argentina, Borussia would have to invest between 25 and 32 million euros, depending on its presentation. However, Inter Milan insists on an (alleged) preliminary contract with Martinez. The implementation of the transfer could be so complicated. In the BVB is one after a thorough assessment but convinced of how Martinez plays football - which is only conditionally for Michy Batshuayi (24). The Chelsea loan, whose future beyond the summer anyway is uncertain, while convinced as an enforcer (seven Bundesliga appearances, six goals, an assist), internally their tactical behavior is judged critically.

(Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Usually Mike Michael Fake Memos Robert Bromwich Ronald Reagan Dem Mueller Brennan Andrew RUSSIA Vicki Divoll Trump Nixon Louis Leon Zero Republicans Capitol Hill McCabe Enterprise Institute Republican UNITED STATES John Freeh Dowd Clinton Senate Intelligence Intelligence Committee Andy Fox News Gary Schmitt Jeremy Bash Lewinsky Richard James Comey GERMANY Panetta Bob Obama

The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China. The most recent prediction involved an episode from almost 20 years ago that predicted Walt Disney Co. took over 21st Century Fox Inc.The November 8, 1998 episode titled 'When You Dish Upon a Star' of the show accurately predicted that one day Disney would take over Fox. In February, it also came to light that The Simpsons predicted the USA would win curling gold and Sweden silver in Winter Olympics Curling, as part of an episode that first aired EIGHT years ago.The prediction features in the 'Boy meets Curl' episode, as Homer and Marge lead Team USA to victory.",Saved Lisa Team Rhyme Century Fox Producer Matt Groening Bengt Holmström Bravo Emc Hawkings Executive Producer United Trump Dish Wasn Future Simpsons Bart Lady Gaga Stephen Hawking UNITED STATES Higgs Boson Matt Sellman Nicely CHINA GREECE Nobel Prize Walt Disney Hollywood Donald Albert Einstein Star Arab Spring SWEDEN FIFA Trumptastic Voyage Fans Galileo Galilei Ebola Super Bowl Brief History Dan Greaney Awesome GERMANY Brain

She had no clinical record of any other diseases, other risk factors, [or] previous reactions of any kind,"" the paper explains.""During an api therapy session, she developed wheezing, dyspnea, and sudden loss of consciousness immediately after a live bee sting.""Although it might sound crazy that she had an allergic reaction after having the procedure so many times before, it's actually more plausible than you'd expect.As the paper mentions, repeated exposure to an allergen - in this case, bee venom - creates a greater risk of a severe allergic reaction than what can be expected in the normal population.The woman was rushed to hospital, and was given a number of compounds to try to stop the reaction, including adrenaline and antihistamines.Unfortunately, despite the treatment, the patient died in hospital from multiple organ failure some weeks later.It's really important to reiterate here that although it is growing in popularity, apitherapy shows very little evidence for being effective for any medical conditions, and this isn't even the first negative reaction to this type of therapy.In fact, a 2015 study published in PLOS One found that ""compared with normal saline injection, bee venom acupuncture showed a 261 percent increased relative risk for the occurrence of adverse events.""Plus, we really need bees doing our pollination right now, not being sacrificed for alternative medicine.Vazquez-Revuelta and Madrigal-Burgaleta's paper sums up nicely: ""the risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable.""We wholeheartedly agree.The paper has been published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology.",Wang Menglin University Hospital Vazquez Revuelta ITALY Madrigal Burgaleta SPAIN Ricardo Madrigal CHINA AUSTRALIA Korea Cajal University PLOS Paula Vazquez Ramon Broadcasting

The West believes Russia was responsible for the tragedy.Voloshin, 29, was a Su-25 pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force when the Boeing 777 was blasted out of the sky on July 17, 2014, leading to 298 deaths.Reports in Ukraine say he was found dead at his home in Mykolayiv from a gunshot wound. A murder probe has been launched by the Ukrainian authorities although initial reports suggest he took his own life.Work colleagues reported that he had been feeling 'depressed'. His wife said she heard a gun shot and ran to him. Reports say she called police and ambulance, but a team of paramedics was unable to save his life.After the Russian accusations originally made in December 2014 , Voloshin quit the Ukrainian air force and since last year was acting director of Mykolayiv International Airport.A BBC documentary in 2016 highlighted the claims which directly conflict with the official Dutch-led probe into the air horror which insists MH17 was downed by a powerful surface-to-air Buk missile shot from pro-Russian rebel held territory.Voloshin said last year: 'I did not shoot down the MH17 Boeing. A former military mate of mine called (Evgeny) Agapov, a mechanical engineer, falsely gave evidence against me.'He stressed: 'We did not carry out flights on July 17.

I'm with Yuri Alexandrovich We'll always meet with him, and as soon as he says to the camera that he considers these elections to be honest, I will immediately shave with him, but I want to hear from him that these elections are honest, - said Grudinin on Monday at a press conference in Tse tral office ""Interfax"" 6 February GRUDININ interviewed Yuri Dudyu in his program ""vDud"" on YouTube. At the end of the program, the presenter offered the candidate a dispute: if Grudinin gets more than 15% in the election, the journalist will shave his nakedness. If he collects less than 15%, then the candidate will shave his mustache, without which, according to his confession, ""no one has ever seen him."" According to preliminary data of the CEC, Grudinin takes second place in the number of votes received after Vladimir Putin. For him voted 11.9% of voters (8 million 648 thousand people).

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controv ersy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, accord ing to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook i nitially denied.By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust, ’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”",UNITED STATES Democrat Munich Senator Honest Data Alex Stamos Clinton Pedro Canahuati YouTube DNC Tavis McGinn RUSSIA Sandy Parakilas Elliot Schrage National Committee Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg Humane Technology Capitol Hill Warner Virginia Yahoo San Francisco
Wall Street Street Journal,"Russia | «Украину никто слушать не будет»: примет ли ЕС меры против Шрёдера за его «поддержку» России | https://russian.rt.com/world/article/493771-klimkin-shreder-sankcii |  Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was attacked by Foreign Minister of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin. The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT.

Andrew Cuomo (D) in the state’s primary election, set for September. The actress is a newcomer to campaigning, but has been involved in politics, especially education policy, for years. “We want our government to work again, on healthcare, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway. We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us,” Nixon said in her announcement.The Wall Street Journal originally reported rumors in late 2017 that Nixon was planning a gubernatorial run, and NY1 followed up this month after Nixon reportedly met with two Democratic strategists. In her two-minute announcement, Nixon focused on her longtime advocacy for public education, reminding voters that she and her three children attended New York City public schools. She also touched on the city’s deteriorating subway system, a topic that has plagued Cuomo for years.  Nixon attacked the incumbent governor directly in her press release. “Cuomo’s time in office has been defined by a string of indictments for corruption, his failure to fix the New York City subway, and his support for a backroom deal which handed Republicans control of the state Senate, resulting in the failure of numerous pieces of progressive legislation,” the press release stated.Nixon has been involved in New York City politics since 2014, when Mayor Bill de Blasio placed her on the advisory board for the Mayor’s Fund To Advance New York City. Christine Marinoni, Nixon’s wife, became the special adviser for community partnerships with the city’s Department of Education that same year.In that time, Nixon has spoken critically about Cuomo’s work as governor in various forums. The actress told “The View” last year that even Cuomo’s most praised policies, such as free tuition at four-year state colleges, barely scratch the surface of the state’s needs. “Basically, it only affects families that earn between $75,000 and $125,000 a year,” Nixon said on “The View.” “And it doesn’t apply to people who go part-time, which means they might have to work while they’re there, or they don’t graduate in four years, or they’re Dreamers.”Nixon also wrote an op-ed for LoHud.com about public school funding that compared Cuomo, a Democrat, to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a Donald Trump nominee.“[Cuomo] also wants to increase the number of privately-run charter schools in New York City by more than 50 percent,” Nixon wrote. “And he has been a loud proponent of private school tax credits, essentially a backdoor voucher system. These are policies we expect from Betsy DeVos, but from Andrew Cuomo?”The award-winning actress is looking to dethrone the two-term governor, who has been battling public transit issues and a federal investigation into his administration’s payroll. Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Cuomo, was found guilty in a corruption scandal after allegedly taking $300,000 in bribes from executives with state business.A Siena College poll released Monday showed that despite the scandal, Cuomo leads Nixon with 66 percent of Democratic voters.Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated Nixon “poses a credible threat” to Cuomo. This story has been updated to include details about a Monday poll that shows Cuomo significantly ahead of Nixon, as well as information about Percoco’s guilty verdict.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Congress UNITED STATES,"United States | There’s Never Been a Native American Congresswoman. That Could Change in 2018. | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html |  ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a state wide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new gene ration of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priorit y in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners , and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”",Warfare Congress Native Democrat Ms Ojibwe Minnesota Legislature Hawaii Indian Barack Obama Laguna Pueblo Health Service Trump Joe Monahan Mark Trahant Deb Haaland Republicans Healthcare National Massachusetts Sharon Clahchischilliage Albuquerque Denise Juneau Antoinette Sedillo Oklahoma MEXICO UNITED STATES Sedillo Lopez Party University Dakota Representatives Elizabeth Warren New MeToo ALBUQUERQUE House Hawaiian Peggy Flanagan Montana Andria Tupola,"United States | Trump declares war on opioid abuse, calls for death penalty for traffickers, more access for treatment | http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/trump-declares-war-on-opioid-abuse-calls-for-death-penalty-for-traffickers-more-access-for-treatment.html |  Speaking from one of the states hardest hit by the opioid epidemic, President Trump on Monday laid out a battle plan that calls for harsher sentences - and even the death penalty - for traffickers.Trump called for expanded treatment options for victims in the Manchester, N.H., speech, but leveled most of his emphasis on beefed-up enforcement. And he heaped plenty of scorn on the people he believes are responsible for as many as 42,000 U.S. deaths per year.""These are terrible people and we have to get tough with those people,"" Trump said of traffickers and dealers. ""This isn’t about committees... this is about winning a very tough problem.""""The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty,"" Trump said, before musing, ""maybe our country is not ready for that.""Trump wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain illicit opioids. The death penalty would be pursued where appropriate under current law. Justice Department says the federal death penalty is available for several limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the ""drug kingpin"" provisions in federal law.Trump reiterated an observation he has shared several times before -- that a person in the U.S. can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but that a drug dealer whose actions could lead to thousands of overdoses can spend little or no time in jail.The president said the feder al government may consider aggressive litigation against pharmaceutical companies deemed complicit in the crisis.""Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you and we will arrest you and we will hold you accountable,"" Trump said.Trump singled out Mexico and China as main sources of illicit opioids. A Drug Enforcement Administration report last year said: ""Seizures indicated that China supplies lower volumes of high-purity fentanyl, whereas fentanyl seizures from Mexico are higher volume but lower in purity.""Smuggling operations in both countries constantly try to elude U.S. officials by selling through the Internet and sending the substances – which chemists for these traffickers often alter to avoid detection – through the U.S. postal service, U.S. officials have said.Trump also announced a nationwide public awareness campaign, as well as increased research and development through public-private partnerships between the federal National Institutes of Health and pharmaceutical companies. He announced a new website, Crisisnextdoor.gov, where people can share their stories about addiction. The hope is that horror stories will scare people away from behavior that could lead to addiction.The Trump administration aims to see the number of filled opioid prescriptions cut by one-third within three years.A third part of the plan addresses improving access to treatment and recovery p rograms that have proven effective. Many health professionals, relatives of those who have died of overdoses and people who have experienced addiction to opioids have been pushing for treatment to be a key component of any campaign to fight the epidemic.""Failure is not an option,"" the president said. ""Addiction is not our future. We will liberate our country from this crisis.""Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a recent CDC report said that the number of people checking into the emergency room after overdosing rose by 30 percent between July 2016 and September 2017.""Drug dealers show no respect for human dignity and put their own greed ahead of the safety and even the lives of others. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent and deadly business: if you want to collect a drug debt, you collect it with the barrel of a gun. As surely as night follows day, violence and death follow drug trafficking, and murder is often a tool of drug traffickers,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions reacted. ""At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.""""We cannot arrest our way out of the opioid epidemic—we tried that and ended up with an even bigger addiction problem and the world’s largest prison population,"" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, R-Ill., responded. ""The war on drugs didn’t work in the 80’s, and it won’t work now by reviving failed deterrence measures like the death penalty for drug dealers.  We must instead crack down on the over-production and over-prescribing of painkillers, and increase treatment for those suffering from addiction—both of which have bipartisan support in Congress.""Last October, Trump declared the crisis a national public health emergency, short of the national state of emergency sought by a presidential commission he put together to study the issue.Meanwhile, Congress plans to weigh a range of bills targeted at curbing the epidemic. The bills cover everything from improving access to treatment to intercepting shipments of illicit opioids en route to the United States.""Our recommendations will be urgent and bipartisan, and they will come very quickly,"" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to published reports.Fox News' Jason Donner, Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Congress Disease Control MEXICO UNITED STATES CHINA Dick Durbin News Jason Jake Gibson Labor Associated Minority Whip Enforcement Administration Drug Enforcement Centers Fox News Trump Education Health Whip Dick Ill Pensions Committee Jason Donner Addiction Senate Minority,"United Kingdom | Trump opioids plan includes death penalty for drug dealers | https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/19/donald-trump-death-penalty-drug-dealers-opioids-new-hampshire |  Donald Trump called on Monday for some drug dealers to receive the death penalty in a new opioids policy rollout in New Hampshire, a state hard hit by the national crisis.“We’re wasting our time if we don’t get tough with drug dealers, and that toughness includes the death penalty,” said Trump in typically combative style.He later added: “The ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty. Maybe our country is not ready for that, it’s possible, it’s possible.” Trump said “personally I can’t understand that” about those opposed to such drastic measures.Some states already charge drug dealers with murder if customers overdose. In Florida, people who provide cocaine, heroin or the powerful opioid fentanyl to a person who dies from using the drug in question can be charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to either life in prison or death.Drug-induced homicide laws, which emerged in the 1980s, are being used more frequently because of the opioids crisis, according to a November 2017 report by the Drug Policy Alliance. However, there is no evidence that such laws reduce drug use.On Monday Trump was effectively sending a message to prosecutors to be harsher on drug dealers, who traffic in street drugs like heroin as well as black market prescription painkillers, such as OxyContin, and various versions of the potent narcotic fentanyl. But he did not call specifically for legislation to expand use of the death penalty for federal drug crimes.The justice department said the federa l death penalty is already available for limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law.The attorney general, Jeff Sessions, attended the event on Monday and sat next to Melania Trump. The DoJ later issued a statement, saying: “At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.”Doug Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it was not clear federal death sentences for drug dealers, even for those whose product causes multiple deaths, would be constitutional. Berman said the issue would be litigated extensively and would have to be definitively decided by the supreme court.New Hampshire has been hit hard by the opioid crisis, a fact Trump acknowledged last August when he said: “We have the drug lords in Mexico that are knocking the hell out of our country. They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire – I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den – [it] is coming from the southern border.”The comment caused offence in the state, with the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan responding: “Instead of insulting people in the throes of addiction, [Trump] needs to work across party lines to actually stem the tide of this crisis.”Though Trump is visiting to lobby for harsher sentencing for opioid-relat ed crimes, New Hampshire is one of many states now pushing criminal justice reform.On Monday, the state judiciary announced it would review bail policies, after nationwide criticism of courts that serve as de facto debtor’s prisons for people too poor to pay bail.In 2012, substance use disorders such as opioid dependence cost New Hampshire $284m in criminal justice costs. More than half of jail and prison costs in the state are attributed to drug abuse, according to a report by the advocacy group New Futures. Nationally, 76% of inmates are believed to have substance use disorders, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Trump, who aims to be seen as tough on crime, has repeatedly highlighted his preference for the “ultimate penalty” for drug dealers.At a Pennsylvania rally this month, Trump told supporters countries like Singapore have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish dealers. He argued that a person in the US can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person, but a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands can spend little or no time in jail.“The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” Trump said in remarks he echoed on Monday.Trump also wants Congress to pass legislation reducing the amount of drugs needed to trigger mandatory minimum sentences for traffickers who knowingly distribute certain opioids, said Andrew Bremberg, Trump’s domestic policy director, who briefed reporters on the White House plan.T he president was joined in New Hampshire by the first lady, Melania Trump, who has shown an interest in the issue, particularly as it pertains to her focus on child welfare.Trump’s plan concerns law enforcement and interdiction to break the international and domestic flow of drugs into and across the US. It also includes broadening education and awareness, expanding access to treatment and recovery efforts and government funding for efforts to develop non-addictive painkillers. He also said that the Department of Justice was “looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies.” Leading opioids makers in the US are already engulfed in a flurry of civil litigation brought by cities, counties and states.Opioids, including prescription opioids, heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 people in the US in 2016, more than any year on record, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We call it the crisis next door because everyone knows someone,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser. “This is no longer somebody else’s community, somebody else’s kid, somebody else’s co-worker.”",OxyContin Congress Donald Trump York Statistics UNITED STATES New Hampshire Ohio State Drug Futures Melania Florida Bureau Policy Alliance Kellyanne Conway Doug Berman Chicago SINGAPORE Andrew Bremberg State University Jeff Sessions Los Angeles Maggie Hassan Justice
Trump Clinton,"United States | Trump to Hire Lawyer Who Has Pushed Theory That Justice Dept. Framed the President | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html |  MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",SEYCHELLES District Columbia UNITED STATES Ms Ethics Toensing MANCHESTER Robert Clinton George diGenova Donald Bush John Dowd Mark Corallo Mueller Justice Department Jr RUSSIA Fox News Flood Trump Erik Prince Sam Clovis Columbia Joe Make Emmet Joseph Republican,"United States | ‘You Will Not Destroy America’: A Trump Battle Is No Longer One-Sided | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html |  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Usually Mike Michael Fake Memos Robert Bromwich Ronald Reagan Dem Mueller Brennan Andrew RUSSIA Vicki Divoll Trump Nixon Louis Leon Zero Republicans Capitol Hill McCabe Enterprise Institute Republican UNITED STATES John Freeh Dowd Clinton Senate Intelligence Intelligence Committee Andy Fox News Gary Schmitt Jeremy Bash Lewinsky Richard James Comey GERMANY Panetta Bob Obama,"United Kingdom | Cynthia Nixon announces she is running for Governor of New York | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5519655/Cynthia-Nixon-announces-running-Governor-New-York.html |  Native New Yorker and Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon has announced her candidacy for Governor of the the Empire State, in a direct challenge to incumbent Andrew Cuomo.Nixon announced her debut in the world of politics with a two-minute video on her social media platforms, where she declared: 'I love New York and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor.'

It was one of the rare times the two have displayed public affection over the past few months. Scroll down for video The First Lady made her displeasure for her husband or PDA very clear last May during a trip overseas. Video of President Trump touching down in Tel Aviv showed the First Lady very clearly slapping at her husband when he tried to hold her hand at Ben Gurion Airport.Melania was walking a half-step behind her husband at the time and managed to rebuff his advance without showing any clear emotion or breaking her stride, while the commander-in-chief responded by using the rejected hand to carefully adjust his tie.It was unclear if this unexpected resistance was the result of any personal turmoil, or simply because of the carpet's narrow size. This slapping move then started popping up every few months. Melania has been showing her face far more in recent months, assuming a more active role in her duties as First Lady.She has also found herself embroiled in controversy however over her husband's alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and questions about how she became an American citizen.PresidentTrump announced on August 9, 2016 at a campaign rally in North Carolina that a press conference would be held in the coming weekend to discuss how his third wife Melania Knaus became an American citizen.That press conference has yet to happen.But a little over a month later, Melania posted a letter from one of her husband's lawyers stating that she had obtained an EB-1 Visa in 2001 and through that was granted citizenship five years later, all on her own accord.This claim has left many puzzled over how Melania would qualify for what has become known as the 'Einstein Visa,' which is reserved for 'persons with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics.'Melania opted for a tweet rather than a press conference in September 2016, taking to Twitter and declaring: 'I am pleased to include a letter from my immigration attorney which states that with 100% certainty I correctly went through the legal process when arriving in the USA.'The letter, from Michael Wildes, stated that Melania first entered the United States on August 27, 1996 with a visitor visa before being granted an H-1B visa that October which allowed her to do modelling work.Wildes stated that she obtained five of those visas until in March 2001 she successfully applied for and was granted her EB-1 visa. At that time, residents of Slovenia were forced to reapply for the H-1B annually, making the EB-1 a far more convenien t option for any 'extraordinary' Slovenians.Melania was just one of six people from her country who was able to obtain an EB-1 back in 2001, making her feat all the more impressive.In order to apply for the EB-1, a foreign-born citizen must 'demonstrate extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics through sustained national or international acclaim.'Applicants must submit evidence to back their claim of 'extraordinary ability' in at least three out of ten criteria, which were outlined in the Immigration Act of 1990.These include receiving nationally or internationally recognized prizes, membership in outstanding achievement organizations, authorship of scholarly articles, commercial success and holding a critical role in distinguished organizations.It is not clear what Melania cited as evidence in her application as she has never spoken about her path to citizenship beyond posting Wildes' letter.Even if that evidence is deemed acceptable, the applicant must then prove they are 'one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor' and show sustained acclaim in their field from peers.Two months after the release of the letter it also emerged that Melania was working in the country prior to receiving her H-1B visa, with records showing she took at least 10 jobs between August and October of 1996 while still on a visitor visa.'I came here for my career, and I did so well, I moved here. It never crossed my mind to stay here without papers,' Melania said in the February 2016 issue of Harper's Bazaar.'That is just the person you are. You follow the rules. You follow the law. Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa. After a few visas, I applied for a green card and got it in 2001. After the green card, I applied for citizenship. And it was a long process.'That interview prompted Wildes to initially claim that Melania had achieved that 2001 visa through marriage, despite the fact that she and Donald did not marry until 2005 in Mar-a-Lago.Wildes then changed his tune a few months later, stating in was an EB-1 Visa that Melania got to stay in the country, which then allowed her to secure citizenship on her own.Musicians John Lennon and Yoko Ono and athletes Dirk Nowitzki and Monica Seles are a few of the famous names who have been granted EB-1 Visas",Marine UNITED STATES Bazaar EB Stormy Daniels PDA Donald Lady Einstein Knaus SLOVENIA Harper Visa Tel Aviv John Lennon Melania Trump Carolina Yoko Ono Michael Wildes Scroll

John Michael,"United States | ‘You Will Not Destroy America’: A Trump Battle Is No Longer One-Sided | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html |  WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were al armed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, inclu ding Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”",Usually Mike Michael Fake Memos Robert Bromwich Ronald Reagan Dem Mueller Brennan Andrew RUSSIA Vicki Divoll Trump Nixon Louis Leon Zero Republicans Capitol Hill McCabe Enterprise Institute Republican UNITED STATES John Freeh Dowd Clinton Senate Intelligence Intelligence Committee Andy Fox News Gary Schmitt Jeremy Bash Lewinsky Richard James Comey GERMANY Panetta Bob Obama,"United Kingdom | Self-driving Uber car kills woman in street in Arizona | https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/19/uber-self-driving-car-kills-woman-arizona-tempe |  An autonomous Uber car killed a woman in the street in Arizona, police said, in what appears to be the first reported fatal crash involving a self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian in the US.Tempe police said the self-driving car was in autonomous mode at the time of the crash and that the vehicle hit a woman, who was walking outside of the crosswalk and later died at a hospital. There was a vehicle operator inside the car at the time of the crash.Uber said in a statement on Twitter: “Our hearts go out to the victim’s family. We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident.” A spokesman declined to comment further on the crash.The company said it was pausing its self-driving car operations in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s CEO, tweeted: “Some incredibly sad news out of Arizona. We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened.”Uber has been testing its self-driving cars in numerous states and temporarily suspended its vehicles in Arizona last year after a crash involving one of its vehicles, a Volvo SUV. When the company first began testing its self-driving cars in California in 2016, the vehicles were caught running red lights, leading to a high-profile dispute between state regulators and the San Francisco-based corporation.Police identified the victim as 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg and said she was walking outside of the crosswalk with a bicycle when she was hit at around 10pm on Sunday. Images from the scene showed a damaged bike. The 2017 Volvo SUV was traveling at roughly 40 miles an hour, and it did not appear that the car slowed down as it approached the woman, said Tempe sergeant Ronald Elcock.Elcock said he had watched footage of the collision, which has not been released to the public. He also identified the operator of the car as Rafael Vasquez, 44, and said he was cooperative and there were no signs of impairment.The self-driving technology is supposed to detect pedestrians, cyclists and others and prevent crashes.John M Simpson, privacy and technology project director with Consumer Watchdog, said the collision highlighted the need for tighter regulations of the nascent technology.“The robot cars cannot accurately predict human behavior, and the real problem comes in the interaction between humans and the robot vehicles,” said Simpson, whose advocacy group called for a national moratorium on autonomous car testing in the wake of the deadly collision.Simpson said he was unaware of any previous fatal crashes involving an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian.Tesla Motors was the first to disclose a death involving a self-driving car in 2016 when the sensors of a Model S driving in autopilot mode failed to detect a large white 18-wheel truck and trailer crossing the highway. The car drove full speed under the trailer, causing the collision that killed the 40-year-old behind the wheel in the Tesla.Earlier this year, California regulators approved the testing of self-driving cars on public roads without human drivers monitoring inside.“The technology is not ready for it yet, and this just sadly proves it,” said Simpson.In one recent incident, California police officers found a Tesla that was stopped in the middle of a five-lane highway and found a driver asleep behind the wheel. The man said the vehicle was in “autopilot”, which is Tesla’s semi-autonomous driver assist system, and he was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.In another recent case, a Tesla car rear-ended a fire truck on a freeway, with the driver again telling the authorities the car was in autopilot mode at the time of the collision.Michael G Bennett, an Arizona State University associate research professor who studies autonomous cars, said the self-driving vehicles have become ubiquitous around campus and on the streets in Tempe. Often they have operators behind the wheels, but sometimes they are fully autonomous with no human inside.The fatal collision could spark significant calls for reform and reflections within the industry, he said.“It may be problematic for the industry, because one of their central arguments for the value of the technology is that it is superior to human drivers,” said Bennett, adding that autonomous cars should be able to detect pedestrians and avoid hitting them, even if they aren’t in crosswalks: “Every day, pedestrians in cities around the world step outside of the crosswalk.”Th e governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has been a strong proponent of allowing corporations to test the technology in his state, publicly slamming other governments for “over regulation” and in 2016 urging Uber to “ditch California” and launch in his region. In March, he issued new rules and said that more than 600 automated vehicles have driven on public roads in the state.“Our prayers are with the victim, and our hearts go out to her family,” Patrick Ptak, Ducey’s spokesman, said in an email to the Guardian, adding, “Public safety is our top priority.”Linda Bailey, the executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials (Nacto), said in an interview that there has not been enough regulatory oversight of testing and that some governments are overwhelmed trying to understand autonomous technology and its limitations.“There’s an essential role for the public sector in regulating the safety of these vehicles, which has been largely left to private companies,” she said, adding that Nacto supports third-party testing of the vehicles.Tempe’s mayor, Mark Mitchell, defended the city’s ongoing support of autonomous vehicles in a statement Monday, saying: “All indications we had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here.”",California Bennett Guardian Volvo Ronald Elcock John Phoenix Consumer Watchdog Patrick Ptak Tesla Motors Dara Khosrowshahi Michael Uber Rafael Vasquez Pittsburgh City Transportation Toronto Doug Ducey Simpson Arizona Earlier Linda Bailey National Association Association City Elaine Herzberg Mark Mitchell Public San Francisco State University Nacto
Atlantic UNITED KINGDOM,"United States | Hidden camera exposes Cambridge Analytica tactics | https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/hidden-camera-shows-cambridge-analytica-pitching-tricky-tactics-n857936 |  In a meeting with the head of Cambridge Analytica — the political data firm used by the Trump campaign in 2016 — reporters from NBC News’ U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 News posed as potential clients interested in changing the outcome of the Sri Lankan elections.The reporters, who were trying to find out how the company operated, quickly learned about the novel and deceptive methods employed by the company, including bribes, blackmail, and misinformation campaigns. The findings were broadcast by the network on Monday.On hidden camera, the reporters recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, ""an offer he can't refuse"" or ""send some girls around to the candidate’s house.""Nix also floated the idea of spreading misinformation about politicians.""It doesn't have to be true,"" Nix said. ""It just has to be believed.""He later discussed creating fake IDs and having people pose as students or tourists as a way to further the political efforts without having its work traced back to clients.Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, was also recorded by the ITN Channel 4 News reporters discussing his relationships with former British spies now working at private companies who can be contracted to gather intelligence, along with private Israeli intelligence companies.Long a company of interest in the Tru mp-Russia investigation, Cambridge Analytica came under fresh scrutiny this past weekend after the company's former director of data research, Christopher Wylie, revealed how the company had mined data from at least 50 million Facebook users.Publicly, the company advertises its ability to build ""psychographic"" profiles that can microtarget social media political advertising to people based on traits like ""extroversion"" or ""neuroticism.""The company received a $15 million investment from wealthy Republican donor Robert Mercer, who also funded the conservative website Breitbart while Steve Bannon — who later became chief executive of Trump’s presidential campaign — was at the helm.A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied to ITN Channel 4 News that it used any of the tactics discussed in the videos.“We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called 'honey-traps' for any purpose whatsoever,"" the spokesperson sent in a statement.“Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose,” the spokesperson added.Bannon met with Nix and was interested in how the profiles could be used to change American politics, Wylie said.""Steve wanted weapons for a culture war. We offered him a way to change the culture of America,"" Wylie told ITN Channel 4 News. Sources familiar with Cambridge Analytica’s work on the Trump campaign say “psychographics” were not used.A source familiar with the hiring of Cambridge An alytica told NBC News that the primary figures involved in the hiring were Jared Kushner and Brad Parscale, who was digital director of the Trump campaign. Parscale has denied that the firm was useful to the campaign and said the Trump campaign instead used data from the Republican National Committee.On Friday, Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from buying ads or administering pages on its platform on behalf of clients, saying its data policies had been violated.""We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,"" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it was investigating the claims.The developments drew rebuke from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic over the weekend.“Revelations that Cambridge Analytica secretly acquired the personal, private information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission or that of Facebook, must be thoroughly investigated,"" Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should appear before the panel to explain what the company knew about the misuse of its customers' data.Those calls were echoed by Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling during Brexit.

When you get a sudden stratospheric warming event like we saw in Jan, it often means you can get more than one/two/three bouts of colder weather. #BeastFromTheEast to be continued...?""Those replying to his post said they hoped snow would not be on the way and that they are ready for Spring to come.And another said: ""It's more common to have a white Easter than a white Christmas and with Easter early this year I wouldn't bet against that continuing to be honest.""Conditions will become unsettled with temperatures starting to edge upwards later this week with periods of drier and bright weather coupled with some heavy rain.But the mercury may fall again during next week as the holiday period approaches.Forecaster Eleanor Bell, of The Weather Channel, said: “Temperatures are expected to gradually rise this week as high pressure sinks southwards.“This will bring in milder air from the west. It will be a dry start to the week before it becomes more unsettled.”There is still uncertainty for the run-up to the Easter Weekend but computer data suggests that the area of high pressure lodged to the north of the country will allow colder Arctic air to plunge downwards towards Britain with the possibility of some wintry spells returning.There is also a risk of rain.But frontal systems from the Atlantic will be locked in a battle for supremacy with the cold air.This will probably bring a spell of unsettled, wet and windy conditions in the south and a risk of more snow at times in the north when moist air from the west collides with the colder blast.Almost all forecasts agree that temperatures will be mostly below average. There is still some uncertainty in the long-range outlook but many computer models are predicting colder, more unsettled conditions to continue well into April.British Summer Time begins at the weekend when the clocks go forward by an hour, but it is highly unlikely that conditions will mirror the change.The Met Office has also said: ""There remains some uncertainty in the forecast for the Easter Weekend, but we are likely to see slow moving weather systems across the UK, with wetter weather more probable in the south, and with drier, colder conditions in the north albiet with a risk of snow at times.""",Met Office Arctic Weekend Atlantic UNITED KINGDOM Summer BBC Simon King White Easter

The representative survey conducted by the pollster Civey deserves much more attention. But it just did not fit into the happy transported world view of the journalists. And she certainly did not fit the Chancellor's agenda. Quite the contrary. The clear answer of the citizens to the question of whether Islam belongs to Germany was a resounding slap in the face for Angela Merkel. She had just recently blabbed out her new interior minister Horst Seehofer publicly that he had dared to pronounce the day before, in which three quarters of the Germans confirm that Islam does not belong to Germany. Only just over 20 percent of the representative respondents think it is Merkel's opinion. where a small group absolutely approves of the question. The number of those who believe that Islam does not belong to Germany is steadily increasing. Last summer, this view represented ""only"" two-thirds of the Germans. The Chancellor is still stuck to her narrative. Bending and breaking should be hammered into the people that they would have to accept as part of their everyday life more and more influential in the wake of immigration religion, as incompatible with the decades-long understanding of democracy and the rule of law may be. The contradiction Merkel's Politburo to the ö Public opinion is so blatant that one has to ask oneself what drives the Chancellor. Nobody can be so ignorant as to be so stubborn against the people. Who writes Merkel's agenda, which seems to focus not least on serving Islam? A huge industry has long since emerged, which ensures across company, association and party boundaries that six million members of a particular religion make public life easier the remaining 77 million citizens. Most Muslims must be held accountable for being abused by politics and the media. But there are a large number of them, who see their religion not only as part of Germany, but work towards the fact that Germany as soon as possible belongs to Islam.Insofern the initial question is wrong, because it does not investigate the widespread rejection, the Hence, the intrusive behavior of the religious associations and the overblown political-media dininess fuel fears of losing public life to Islam. It can not surprise anyone if three-quarters of Germans oppose the idea of ​​eventually having to submit to Islam. And the concern is by no means as unfounded as politics and the media like to claim. Because the concessions to the Muslim religious community already intervene deeply in the social life. Separate swimming pool times for women at the expense of time For sport clubs, the renaming of Christ markets as a contribution to interfaith dialogue, and the banishment of pork from daycare cafeterias are far more than consideration - they are anticipatory obedience. Not to mention truck barriers to secure entire pedestrian areas and police escorts for the protection of paramedics , The enumeration can be continued to the point of self-flagellation of repentant companies for alleged anti-Muslim advertising. For this purpose, questionable associations get a say in government-related bodies, are installed at all political levels integration commissioners and subordinate to public bodies as well as private institutions as expensive as bizarre tolerance competition. Right of way for Islam, wherever one looks. Angela Merkel once again missed a chance: Instead of using the debate to confidently insist that religions have to submit to a free society, she has with her confession, the Islam belongs to Germany, to those who give absolution, who have no interest in assimilating. A responsible policy must not only protect religion from the state, but vice versa. Angela Merkel probably did not understand this aspect of her oath of office.

The head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry accused Schroeder of promoting the Russian projects abroad and being a ""lobbyist for Putin."" ""Gerhard Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin around the world. Therefore, we should study how the EU can act in this situation, ""Klimkin said in an interview with Bild.In particular, he suggested considering possible sanctions against the ex-chancellor:"" It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin's projects abroad ""- added the minister. Such a reaction of the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry triggered the words of Gerhard Schroeder about the unwillingness to somehow change his attitude towards the Russian leader. In particular, he said this in the film ""Putin,"" two parts of which were published on social networks on March 11 and 15. He also noted earlier that stability in Eastern Europe and the Middle East is impossible without the cooperation of the countries of Europe and the United States with the Russian Federation . However, experts believe that restrictive measures for Schröder from the European Union are unlikely. In this regard, the appeals of the Ukrainian minister will remain unanswered: ""No Klimkin will listen to the EU. He is not the kind of person to be attracted to in Europe. Ukrainian politicians will once again show their bad character before the European Union. And it will be quite a problem partner for Europe. Maybe they think that they beat Ukraine off from Russia. But I would not say that this is a great gift "", - p Timothy Bordachev, director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, said that German business is interested in Russian gas, which is now supplied by the Nord Stream stream. ""Germany is the main hub of Russian gas in Europe. German corporations extract huge profits from this. Naturally, no one will seriously do anything against the ""Nord Stream"", ""the expert added. Schröder's relations with Russia, indeed, often become a reason for criticism in the West. In particular, The Wall Street Journal in a negative way expresses its support for the Nord Stream project and the signing in 2005 of an agreement with Russia on its construction. In addition, Schröder's participation in the Nord Stream shareholder committee, the board of directors of Severnogo flow - 2 ""and"" Rosneft "". At the same time, he joined the latter in September 2017 and is an independent director. In addition, the ex-politician does not own shares of the company and refused to pay for work in Rosneft. Despite this, WSJ called Schroeder a Trojan horse. ""Mr. Schroeder was a Trojan horse who opposed all European Union commitments to curb the impact of Russian energy and increase the competitiveness of its gas market,"" the March 16 edition of the article says. In this regard, The Wall Street Journal is surprised that no one in the US and the EU has yet imposed sanctions on the ex-chancellor. Meanwhile, Some experts believe that there is a possibility that some of the countries of the European Union will pay attention to Klimkin's proposal, albeit theoretically. In particular, Dmitry Abzalov, president of the Center for Strategic Communications, is of the opinion: ""The EU is, of course, big. There remains a theoretical possibility that one of the other EU countries such as Estonia or Latvia will support it (Klimkina .- RT). But the question is that Germany, which, in fact, is one of the main initiators of the construction of the Nord Stream-2, is very unlikely to support Klimkin's position. It's another matter that attacking the positions of a representative of political groups that do not suit Ukraine without being a member of the European Union is a very serious pressure on Germany, and not the fact that Merkel will adequately react to it. It's one thing to declare the extreme of Moscow, and another - to demand sanctions against a German citizen, ""Abzalov explained in an interview with RT. In this connection, he believes that the Ukrainian minister is only trying to warm up interest in his country.",Dmitry Abzalov Merkel UNITED STATES Pavel Klimkin LATVIA Trojan UKRAINE Bild Schröder Despite Strategic Communications Timothy Bordachev WSJ RUSSIA Gerhard Schroeder Wall Street Street Journal Rosneft GERMANY Nord Stream Eastern ESTONIA Middle East

This happened on March 6 at a primary school in Nimburg (Baden-Württemberg). The boy had been conspicuous before and all the teachers in the school knew his inclination to violence. A letter was then sent to the education office in Freiburg asking for the boy to be placed in a suitable facility - but nothing happened Schulamt, the mayor and the youth welfare office had classified the incident as not so dramatic. The boy has slightly hurt the teacher with the fruit knife, they say. But the injured teacher sees it a little differently. She then spoke up at the ""Bild"". Sabine T. (54, name changed) is a member of the teachers' union GEW. The boy was already noticeable in the day care center, she said. Then at the end of January a letter was sent to the Freiburg School Office. In this letter, the school authorities were informed that a teacher could no longer guarantee the safety of his students. Because the boy is due to the daily incidents - biting and beating of classmates and teachers, throwing chairs - not predictable and difficult to control, it says in the ""Bild"" .Also parents were worried about the safety of their children because of the student. For the boy was already in the wrong direction for a year and a half, and if he was in the right institution, much could have been done for him Sabine T. describes the ""image"" as the attack has expired: The boy had repeatedly disturbed the class and then she had put him in the hallway. Later she had looked after him and suddenly he had held a knife (about 9 cm blade) in his hand - which apparently came from the craft corner. She had to undergo surgery in the hospital - the wound could be treated, but the Fear remained. ""I get panic attacks when I think of school,"" says the teacher, who has been home since the incident. The mayor of Teningen-Nimburg, Heinz-Rudolf Hagenacker, said of the incident: ""I strongly oppose the stigmatization of a seven-year-old child who obviously has difficulties at school He has known the case since Tuesday and before that the boy was not known to him. He also referred to the youth welfare office and the school social work for the processing of the incident, as the ""Bild"" further reported.Sozialdezernentin the district, Ulrike Kleinknecht-Strähle, spoke of a regrettable incident for all parties. The youth welfare office is in contact with the school authorities and will have discussions with the parents of the boy and with the school, according to Kleinknecht-Strähle. The Youth Welfare Office also takes its role to work it out and find a solution, she added Press Secretary of Regieru ng presidium, Markus Adler, said that school psychologists are generally available for such cases.

It will be as Florida High’s head basketball coach in what amounts to Ward’s first head coaching opportunity in the sport. The past four years, he was head football coach at Pensacola’s Booker T. Washington High School.“I’ve played 11 years of (NBA) basketball and coached two,” Ward told the Democrat.. “I’ve been coaching football for the past nine years. It’s a bit of a change, but I’ve been helping out with Booker behind the scenes.“My (football) win-loss record isn’t the best, but I’ve been able to help provide structure and get some things done at the programs. This may be the first time I’ve had a stable situation.”Ward, 47, wasn’t expecting this, but over the past 13 years since his NBA career ended in Houston, he’s been inching back toward his hometown of Thomasville, Georgia.He spent nine years in Houston overall, spending two seasons as an assistant coach for the Rockets, before being hired in 2007 as an assistant coach on the varsity boys basketball team at Westbury Christian School.That year, Westbury hired Ward to become its football coach. After six seasons at Westbury, Booker T. Washington hired Ward in 2014, where he’s been the past four years.When Ward and his family began discussing a move to get back to Tallahassee – his oldest son, Caleb, 18, graduates high school in May – he put out feelers, which resulted in the recent hire by FSU and President John Thrasher to become a university ambassador.RELATED: Charlie Ward returning to Florida State in ambassador roleMORE: Ward the 'perfect choice' to join FSU as an ambassadorFollowing his hire, Ward stepped down from his position at Washington. But he still had the itch to coach.NEWS-JOURNAL: Charlie Ward resigns as football coach at Booker T. Washington“President Thrasher and those guys were helpful getting me to the area,” Ward said. “While I was thinking about that and what to do at the university, (Florida High athletic director) Tyrone (McGriff) and I were talking about something else. At that time, I wasn’t looking for a job. God opened the door. We’re looking forward to the opportunity.”McGriff inquired about Ward’s potential interest in becoming a head basketball coach as part of McGriff’s vision toward building up his school’s facilities and coaching staffs to be the best in the state for the Seminoles’ classification.To fully realize his vision, McGriff wanted to promote existing boys basketball coach Todd McNeil to become the assistant athletic director.McNeil has been Florida High’s coach for the past two seasons, following an off year after getting fired by Chiles in 2015 following his 13th season. McNeil’s replacement, John Langlois, was just fired by the Ti mberwolves after three sub-.500 seasons.NEXT MAN UP: Florida High hires veteran coach McNeil to guide boys basketball“Todd is extremely organized, one of the most organized people I know,” McGriff said. “He has a plan for everything. He knows where things are going. With someone like him, you don’t want to lose him because he’s too good, too valuable.“I wanted him to help us overall, not just in basketball. I want him to be in a position to help me, set schedules, work on new policies in writing, and help establish this vision I have for our athletics program. I can’t do it by myself.”Ward will travel back and forth from Pensacola in the interim until the school year ends. He has regular speaking engagements and his new role at FSU.The family – wife Tonja and children Hope, 14, and Joshua, 9 – will move over the summer. Family was a big factor in the move. Ward’s four siblings and both his parents still live in Thomasville.“Charlie is real big-hearted and he thinks about other people,” McGriff said. “Anytime you have someone like that with the reputation he has, you seize the opportunity.”Ward spent nine seasons with the New York Knicks, having been drafted by Hall of Fame coach Pat Riley. But he also had four coaches during that span, including six seasons with Jeff Van Gundy.Van Gundy later brought Ward to Houston and helped him get his coaching start.Ward thinks he’ll draw on what he experienced from Van Gundy as well as Greg Popovich during a half season with the San Anto nio Spurs as he begins his own basketball coaching journey.SPEAKING: Charlie Ward talks to youth, offers map to success“The things Pop did in practice was very good developmental wise,” Ward said. “I’m reserved, but I can raise my voice – it is a gym. I’m more reserved in basketball than football.“I played differently than I act. That’s how I’ll coach my guys – to play with intensity, play for one another, be a good teammate, play your role, and everyone has to play good team defense. That was my M.O.”Following a 1-24 season in 2015-16, McNeil’s first season with the Seminoles was a 5-19 result. Despite starting three freshmen, a sophomore and an eighth-grader this past season, Florida High improved to 8-19 and nearly made the playoffs.The youthfulness showed up in a District 2-5A semifinal loss, giving up a lead late to top seed Marianna.FEATURED: Florida High's youthful basketball team learning the hard wayBolstered by 6-foot-6 freshman center Makai Willis, 6-5 freshman forward Kai Farlin, and freshman guard Terrion Arnold (12.6 ppg), along with 6-2 sophomore Willie Taggart Jr., the Seminoles’ returning roster has undeniable upside.“They have some young talent, and the key to anything is experience and maturation,” Ward said. “The one thing they all have to learn is talent alone doesn’t provide success. I just want to instill in them the work ethic and what they need.“Can’t take shortcuts. Give them a sense of pride being able to compete at a high level. It won’t be easy, b ut nothing in life is easy. Coach McNeil did a great job with them. I’ll just continue to build upon what he established.”",Houston Jeff Van Democrat John Thrasher Family FSU RELATED Marianna Taggart Jr Westbury Booker NFL Pat Riley Willie Taggart Seminoles Tyrone Pensacola High Christianity Florida State NEWS UNITED STATES York Knicks Greg Popovich Todd McNeil Makai Willis Charlie Ward MAN NBA Langlois roleMORE Tallahassee Anytime San Anto Van Gundy McGriff New York School Rockets
Munich,"Germany | Große Koalition: Festhalten! Rechtskurve! | http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/grosse-koalition-kaum-im-amt-blinkt-sie-schon-nach-rechts-kolumne-a-1198779.html |  ""Haut'se, haut'se, always on the muzzle!"" This is a motto that has so far not been associated with Angela Merkel's style of politics. Nevertheless, the fourth cabinet of the Chancellor takes up his work with unfamiliar roughness. Islam, poverty, abortion - the new government was barely in office and immediately ignited a firework of right-wing blast. Or is this a sign of Merkel's loss of control? Or the expression of a general mood, which - in a modification of a famous presidential statement - has the one demand: through Germany, a shift to the right! Horst Seehofer and Jens Spahn have in the Cabinet Merkel IV the role of conservative bang batches. Within a few days, one has expatriated Islam from Germany and the other only insulted Hartz IV recipients as crybabies and then compensated for abortions against animal welfare. Politics of the center is different. But who says that this government will make a policy of the middle? It is part of the essence of the Union to represent mostly the so-called healthy sense of the people. And right now, that's right. On the internet, you can read a ""2018 statement,"" which reads: ""We are watching with increasing consternation how Germany is damaged by illegal mass immigration, and we are solidarizing ourselves with those who peacefully demonstrate for it that the rule of law is restored at the borders of our country. "" These people talk about the law aat - in truth, they want the Rechtsruck.Vornweg run the usual suspects - Sarrazin, Broder, Lengsfeld -, followed by a lot of AfD sympathizers and other brown socks. And then there are all the angry professors and doctorses, the sour creme de la creme of the worried German bourgeoisie. They can not assert any extenuating circumstances for themselves - heavy Eastern childhood, fear of globalization or something - they know exactly what they are doing: they want pure Germany. And Horst Seehofer also knows what he does when he gives sugar to such people. ""Islam does not belong to Germany"" - the sentence was deliberately unclear because its meaning is completely different, depending on whether one understands it normatively or descriptively. Seehofer knows that, of course. But he does not care. In Bavaria is campaigning, Markus Söder had his first day in the State Chancellery - two good reasons to let out the Horst. And when it comes to Muslims, applies not only in Munich, the old sentence of Monaco Franze: A little bit what is always. But not the Muslims are the problem, but the potato Germans. Unfortunately, quite a few are grumpy, anxious, spoiled and haughty - and the dull-cheeked populism comes along, the greater is his chance of success with these people. Horst Seehofer's zenith as a populist is already behind him - but Jens Spahn still has his own. His comments on Hartz IV - is not poverty, one comes super with clear - could perhaps still be recorded as a typical cold-blooded capitalist sinism with which the better-off people have always looked down on the poor. However, what he said in the debate on paragraph 219a went one step further: ""When it comes to the lives of animals, some who now want to promote abortions are uncompromising, but sometimes there is not much going on in this debate considers that it is about unborn human life. ""Who is campaigning for abortion? What is Spahn talking about? Advertising for abortion would be for example: ""Abortion: the best thing about the North."" Or: ""Abortion ... I like it!"" Maybe also: ""losing weight without sports."" Or just like in the L'Tur advertisement: ""Nix wie weg!"" But the new health minister should know that the discussion is not about advertising, but about information. Of course he knows that. Right-wing populists always sell their audiences more stupid than they are themselves. When rights talk: like bookseller Heinz Ostermann of Terror Hartz IV: Black-Red is supposed to be a coalition of small people. Ulrike Winkelmann has her doubts there

Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamos’s day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said.Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebook’s product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said.Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controv ersy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders — including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer — have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company.The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the company’s executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebook’s image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism.One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter.“The people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,” said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people.Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, “These are really challenging issues, and I’ve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.” On Twitter, he said he was “still fully engaged with my work at Facebook” and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans.Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamos’s departure.Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was “productive.”Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said.By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a “pretty crazy idea.”In the ensuing months, Facebook’s security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, accord ing to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company.Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees.A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebook’s findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular.Mr. Stamos said in his statement that “we decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.”But Facebook’s decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook i nitially denied.By last September, after Mr. Stamos’s investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate.In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebook’s revelation was a good first step, “I’m disappointed it’s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they’ve become much more transparent.”And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube.The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017.Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebook’s reputation in different countries, said Facebook is “caught in a Catch-22.”“Facebook cares so much about its image that the executives don’t want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,” he said. “But if they don’t, it damages their image.”Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the company’s conduct.By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebook’s general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos’s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook’s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook’s representative at the Munich Security Conference.Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook’s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos’s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.“I told them, ‘Your business is based on trust, and you’re losing trust, ’” said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. “They were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it’s a business problem. I couldn’t believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.”",UNITED STATES Democrat Munich Senator Honest Data Alex Stamos Clinton Pedro Canahuati YouTube DNC Tavis McGinn RUSSIA Sandy Parakilas Elliot Schrage National Committee Sheryl Sandberg Mark Zuckerberg Humane Technology Capitol Hill Warner Virginia Yahoo San Francisco

Gatzer had left the Ministry until the end of last year to hire at the Deutsche Bahn. Even more spectacular is the second persona: Jörg Kukies, previously co-head of Germany at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, should take care of a state official for international financial architecture. The Germany Head of the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs joins the Federal Ministry of Finance as a State Secretary. Kukies has been at the helm of Goldman Sachs in Germany since 2014. He has been working for the US investment bank in London and Frankfurt since 2001. Investment banker in the lead of a SPD ministry Kukies has been a member of the SPD for many years and as predecessor of Andrea Nahles was Juso's boss in Rhineland-Palatinate. Nevertheless, an investment banker in the head of a SPD ministry is at least unusual. From the economic wing of the SPD there was praise for the decision: It was ""brilliant to get a Secretary of State with proven international expertise,"" said Harald Christ, treasurer of the SPD On the other hand, there may also be reservations about a Goldman Sachs man in government. In the US, the switch from investment bank to ministry has a long tradition. Also, the current US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchi He once worked for Goldman. Kukies is a recognized connoisseur of the financial markets - and one of the best-earning bank managers in Germany. He will have to exchange his millions in salary for a State Secretary salary, which is around 160,000 euros per year, without surcharges.From the train back to the ministryAlso the second state secretary in Scholz Ministry comes from the economy: Werner Gatzer had only at the beginning of the year Deutsche Bahn started as head of DB Station & Service. The 59-year-old was already from 2005 to 2017 finance secretary of state and responsible for the budget. Gatzer served - which rarely happens - ministers of different parties, first Peer Steinbrück (SPD), then Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU). This was proof of his expertise. Because of the long formation of a government, there is considerable time pressure in the preparation of a new budget, which is to be adopted by the Bundestag and Bundesrat by July. The new ministers are likely to try to implement many projects of the coalition agreement - it is important to keep the financial scope in view.

The incumbent president received 77% of the votes cast by the electors who took part in the elections, and more than 50% - from the total payroll structure, after processing 99.9% of the ballots. This happens in Russia for the first time. The population supports Putin's foreign and domestic policies, and there is no alternative candidate, analysts of Alfa Bank state. The powerful support of the population gives the president the mandate for economic reforms - but he is unlikely to use them, they believe. After the elections, the government will focus on budgetary policy, and structural reforms will push back into the background, the note by Alfa Bank notes. But the support of voters can strengthen Russia's attempts to challenge the dominant role of the United States in the world, analysts believe. Analysts believe that it is not possible to interpret the results of the election so unambiguously, says Kirill Tremasov, director of the analytical department of Loko-Investa: the main task for the next term is to revive the economy. Without solving this problem, Putin's nuclear electorate can significantly reduce, the expert continues. ""He was forgiven for the economic failure in these six years for the Crimea, which divided people with liberal views on the economy in two, no matter what they said, but this electorate in large cities is estimated at tens of percent,"" Tremasov argues. But another six years of stagnation would be a very difficult test for the population. Nevertheless, now the task of reviving the economy is most likely to be considered without serious structural reforms (courts, state regulation, privatization) and the main emphasis will be placed on credit stimulation of economic growth, Tremasov said. ""In the short term, this can give a positive result, and then interest in structural reforms will really disappear completely,"" he believes. As a rule, the ""window of opportunities"" for reforms opens immediately after the elections, noted the head of the Economic Expert Group Evsei Gurvich: the elected leader receives a mandate even for unpopular reforms. On the eve of the third term, Putin had already proposed a program of reforms, the main tasks of which included his May decrees. For example, he instructed by 2018 to increase investments to 27% of GDP, and labor productivity - by 1.5 times, to raise Russia in the World Bank rating on the conditions of doing business from 120th to 20th place, to increase real wages in 1 , 4-1.5 times, salaries of teachers, doctors and scientists - up to 100-200% of the average for the region. But after the elections, the incentives for reforms were weakened by high oil prices, and then the events in Ukraine and sanctions followed, priorities changed, Gurvich said: it was necessary to restore macroeconomic stability, and geopolitics came to the fore. These presidential elections were exceptional in that, that the winning candidate did not set out an economic program at all, Economist of the BCS Vladimir Tikhomirov: there were no program statements, and from the clarifications of the future agenda Putin did not dodge at all. But he links it to the fact that after the election, Putin will take unpopular measures - the president received a very strong mandate of trust. Now there are many fundamental problems that need to be addressed: to change the structure of the economy, reform the pension system, and improve the demographic situation, Tikhomirov lists: without reforms, the economy can not grow faster. Indicative will be the composition of the government - whether Putin will appoint reformers or leave the previous team, he concludes. Changes in the government will occur after the inauguration, Putin said on Sunday after the election. Last week Putin again instructed the government to ensure the growth rate of the Russian economy is higher than the world level. Russia's economy is returning to cyclical growth, but without structural reforms it will be low - about 1.5-2 % per year, was noted in the economic monitoring of the Russian Academy of Science and Technology. Three key reform strategies were discussed: the Ministry of Economic Development proposes to stake on the growth of investments, non-primary exports and labor productivity, the Center for Strategic Research (TsSR) Alexei Kudrin - on the growth of aggregate factor productivity and investments in the most productive sectors, the Stolypin Club of the business ombudsman Boris Titov - to support a moderately weak exchange rate and stimulate demand for import substitution. Kudrin proposed a budget maneuver to accelerate GDP growth: reduce непро unproductive expenditures and increase spending on education, health care and infrastructure. This possibility is discussed, the participants in the meetings in the government and the presidential administration told in January and Interfax was confirmed by the presidential aide Andrei Belousov. The CSR suggested investing 2.3% of GDP in human capital and infrastructure. In his message to the Federal Assembly, Putin announced an increase in spending on medicine and infrastructure, just 1.5% of GDP per year would be required to fulfill the president's message, according to Belousov (quoted by Interfax) .The question is where to get the money. You can increase tax revenues by reducing the shadow sector, optimizing the cost of social support, offered the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov. The first proposal after the elections will be an increase in the personal income tax (now - 13%), Bloomberg reported. During Putin's new term, reforms can be held in the social spheres - education and healthcare, as well as the pension system: first of all, retirement age, says director of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics Natalia Akindinova. She also expects reforms in the sphere of public administration - the change in the work of control and supervisory bodies and elimination of duplicative functions of ministries. But without serious changes in the business climate and a decline in the state's share in the economy, it is not possible to increase the growth of investments in fixed assets, as Putin entrusted, and Akindinov is skeptical. By the long-term forecast of the Center for Development of the Higher School of Economics, by the end of Putin's new term, the growth rate of the economy will remain at the level of 2%.",Development Academy Alexei Kudrin Technology Evsei Gurvich Interfax Ministry Expert Group World RUSSIA Tikhomirov Vladimir Putin Akindinov BCS Anton Siluanov Andrei Belousov Kirill Tremasov Economic Expert Strategic GDP UKRAINE Alfa Bank Group Evsei Boris Titov

The financing of the luxury life completed the family ties by ransacking of banks by real estate loans, social service providers and especially senior citizens throughout Germany.

Hello! This is Sergey, the editor. For a long time I watched Varlamov postulate his theses about the benefits of elections in Russia, but even my patience comes to an end.

No more strength to listen to this nonsense ... Maybe we will discuss?



1. You can not go to elections

Here everything is simple. If you are against the regime, but go to the polls, then you automatically contribute to its legitimization. If you are against Putin, but go to the polls, then you are for Putin. In today's Russia, the only adequate and only visible way to state your protest is to completely ignore the electoral system.

You are aware that without throwing in will not do. You know that, perhaps, the main opposition politician in the country is not allowed before the elections on artificial grounds. On your eyes, the regime in the most fantastic ways tries to increase the turnout, so that more sheep come to the slaughterhouse from the free pastures. But you still drag yourself to the site to pay your respects to Mr. Putin.

Remember: if you urge to go to the polls without fail to ""express your opinion"", then you are a man harmful to Russia. As harmful as any system manager from EdRa.

""Go on dick, beaver collar, I'm not going to play by your rules!"" - that's what you have to say.

Here an impatient reader, a dashing quilted jacket or a ""permitted"" apple-type liberal already wants to accuse me of sympathy for Navalny, but he is disappointed. I have no sympathy for Navalny. It was once, in 2009-2010, but it all came out.

The fact is that in the talent those instantly change their shoes Navalny is like a 9th grade student, at a rush to a kiosk for beer and cigarettes, but still unable to overcome the checkpoint on duty without a change.

In December 2011, Navalny shouted into the microphone that the Kremlin can be taken even now. In August 2013, he willingly used the signatures of ""EdRa"" to run for the post of the mayor of Moscow. Now that he was not allowed to vote before the elections, Navalny immediately made a poker deal and said that the election is, it turns out, full of bullshit, and all of us were dragged bad cats by the nose!

In short, this way: I am very grateful to the UVP of the Administration of the President of Russia for instructing Mr. Navalny and his supporters on the true path. So we will win!



Those who constantly go to the polls and then beleaguered polls from polling stations should ask themselves one simple question: what good happened in the political life of Russia in the past 6 and a half years?

Well, at first, the Moscow opposition tusovka moved from ""Jean-Jacques"" to Telegram (and some also abroad). This is the main achievement, I believe. Prisoners of Marsh went out of prison. Someone received fresh grants. The site ""Mediason"" (I'm serious this time: this is really very important and very useful). Katz and Gudkov conducted a municipal campaign, and then - you will not believe it! - razosralis ... And that defended the independent mundepy Moscow trolleybus or green blocks of Khrushchev? Ah ha ha ha ha!

A significant victory, in fact, was only one - the advent of Roizma on to Ekaterinburg. But it, as I understand it, some kind of concession to the authorities personally Prokhorov, and not you. In addition, Roizman was a political freak even by the standards of the opposition.

Nemtsov was killed. The system makers of Ulyukaev and Belykh are sitting. Semisystemist Urlashov is sitting. If even one more independent mayor or governor is elected, he will be imprisoned too. How do you like this situation, dear fans of campaigns for elections? Is this an honest game, or was the bottle neck just anatomical enough?


2. Putin's interest is not an invention of the Kremlin

Yes, here I agree with Varlamov. The blatant screams of demshiz that Putin does not enjoy popular support is some kind of enchanting delirium.

When the leader, pumped up with propaganda, gives the illusion of power and greatness to a humiliated (even if supposedly humiliated) country, this always brings fruit. This was the case when Hitler was building the ideology of his state on the basis of hatred of internal and external enemies. The masses applauded him when he seized Austria and tore Czechoslovakia apart. Europe was shaking and was unable to intervene ...

Does not it look like anything?


3. Russia is ruled by grandmothers

The core of Putin's electorate is women over 45 years old. The most fat layer of those who vote for Putin is a grandmother from the age of 60. Who sit at home, do nothing, watch television, enjoy the success of the country listed in the program ""Time"", and they want you all to live in shit.

Is it possible to change this statistics or somehow draw it to your advantage? Not sure. And in general, how much Putin can a country still swallow?

Kaza The dependence should be very simple: the worse the people live, the weaker the position of the government. But this is all nonsense. The historical experience of Russia (Ivan IV, Stalin - yes anyone) and the life of some modern states (DPRK, Venezuela, African dictatorships) clearly demonstrates that peoples are subject to the Stockholm syndrome no worse than individuals. This means that Russia will accept Putin until one of the two elements disappears: either Putin or Russia. Or maybe both.

And then I turn to the last point.


4. Salvation of drowning people - not business

So, the Russians have made their choice. For the next 20 years, a noble cross between the Politburo and the State Emergency Committee will rule the country. The other day you will for sure reveal the secret of stability and continuity of the process of getting up from your knees.

But since Russia is a country of forestry, when you cut a forest, you will surely fly to a well-groomed person. And there are some points to which you will have to take your understanding:

If suddenly it turns out that the cops shoved your child into a ""bobik"", taken to the police station and tortured all night with an electric shock, do not be too surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your mother has cancer, but you can not get painkillers for her, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your uncle was summoned from the reserve and sent off to fight somewhere, and there he was cut off his head, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your sister was carried away by feminism, and her brave Cossacks whipped her for this, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly ok It seems that your dog was knocked down by a buoyant judge on his BMW, and then you had to pay for the repair of his car, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that your business was squeezed out by an ethnic organized crime group, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the Kremlin was demolished, in order to build a shopping mall and an elite 40-story LCD, instead of it, do not be surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that a park was cut down next to your house and a temple and a junction built in its place, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that there is no longer a trolley and a tram in your city, although it has always been (even in the ""dashing 90s""), do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the road surface in your city has eroded to the mantle of the Earth, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your street was flooded with the blood of sacrificial rams, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 5,000 people were killed at the plant of your monotown, and then they closed the enterprise altogether, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that you can not go to Turkey or Egypt, because it requires an exit visa, which is given only to spies and artists of the Bolshoi Theater, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that all the decent products from the stores have disappeared, and instead of them there is a ""plastic porridge"" on the shelves, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that you were given a hectare of land in the Far East, and then the Ministry of Defense, FSO or the FSB seized it for their own needs, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your cottage has collapsed full th Heptyla Proton-M rocket with another satellite, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 30 years have passed, and no Russia is already there, do not be very surprised.

It will be as Florida High’s head basketball coach in what amounts to Ward’s first head coaching opportunity in the sport. The past four years, he was head football coach at Pensacola’s Booker T. Washington High School.“I’ve played 11 years of (NBA) basketball and coached two,” Ward told the Democrat.. “I’ve been coaching football for the past nine years. It’s a bit of a change, but I’ve been helping out with Booker behind the scenes.“My (football) win-loss record isn’t the best, but I’ve been able to help provide structure and get some things done at the programs. This may be the first time I’ve had a stable situation.”Ward, 47, wasn’t expecting this, but over the past 13 years since his NBA career ended in Houston, he’s been inching back toward his hometown of Thomasville, Georgia.He spent nine years in Houston overall, spending two seasons as an assistant coach for the Rockets, before being hired in 2007 as an assistant coach on the varsity boys basketball team at Westbury Christian School.That year, Westbury hired Ward to become its football coach. After six seasons at Westbury, Booker T. Washington hired Ward in 2014, where he’s been the past four years.When Ward and his family began discussing a move to get back to Tallahassee – his oldest son, Caleb, 18, graduates high school in May – he put out feelers, which resulted in the recent hire by FSU and President John Thrasher to become a university ambassador.RELATED: Charlie Ward returning to Florida State in ambassador roleMORE: Ward the 'perfect choice' to join FSU as an ambassadorFollowing his hire, Ward stepped down from his position at Washington. But he still had the itch to coach.NEWS-JOURNAL: Charlie Ward resigns as football coach at Booker T. Washington“President Thrasher and those guys were helpful getting me to the area,” Ward said. “While I was thinking about that and what to do at the university, (Florida High athletic director) Tyrone (McGriff) and I were talking about something else. At that time, I wasn’t looking for a job. God opened the door. We’re looking forward to the opportunity.”McGriff inquired about Ward’s potential interest in becoming a head basketball coach as part of McGriff’s vision toward building up his school’s facilities and coaching staffs to be the best in the state for the Seminoles’ classification.To fully realize his vision, McGriff wanted to promote existing boys basketball coach Todd McNeil to become the assistant athletic director.McNeil has been Florida High’s coach for the past two seasons, following an off year after getting fired by Chiles in 2015 following his 13th season. McNeil’s replacement, John Langlois, was just fired by the Ti mberwolves after three sub-.500 seasons.NEXT MAN UP: Florida High hires veteran coach McNeil to guide boys basketball“Todd is extremely organized, one of the most organized people I know,” McGriff said. “He has a plan for everything. He knows where things are going. With someone like him, you don’t want to lose him because he’s too good, too valuable.“I wanted him to help us overall, not just in basketball. I want him to be in a position to help me, set schedules, work on new policies in writing, and help establish this vision I have for our athletics program. I can’t do it by myself.”Ward will travel back and forth from Pensacola in the interim until the school year ends. He has regular speaking engagements and his new role at FSU.The family – wife Tonja and children Hope, 14, and Joshua, 9 – will move over the summer. Family was a big factor in the move. Ward’s four siblings and both his parents still live in Thomasville.“Charlie is real big-hearted and he thinks about other people,” McGriff said. “Anytime you have someone like that with the reputation he has, you seize the opportunity.”Ward spent nine seasons with the New York Knicks, having been drafted by Hall of Fame coach Pat Riley. But he also had four coaches during that span, including six seasons with Jeff Van Gundy.Van Gundy later brought Ward to Houston and helped him get his coaching start.Ward thinks he’ll draw on what he experienced from Van Gundy as well as Greg Popovich during a half season with the San Anto nio Spurs as he begins his own basketball coaching journey.SPEAKING: Charlie Ward talks to youth, offers map to success“The things Pop did in practice was very good developmental wise,” Ward said. “I’m reserved, but I can raise my voice – it is a gym. I’m more reserved in basketball than football.“I played differently than I act. That’s how I’ll coach my guys – to play with intensity, play for one another, be a good teammate, play your role, and everyone has to play good team defense. That was my M.O.”Following a 1-24 season in 2015-16, McNeil’s first season with the Seminoles was a 5-19 result. Despite starting three freshmen, a sophomore and an eighth-grader this past season, Florida High improved to 8-19 and nearly made the playoffs.The youthfulness showed up in a District 2-5A semifinal loss, giving up a lead late to top seed Marianna.FEATURED: Florida High's youthful basketball team learning the hard wayBolstered by 6-foot-6 freshman center Makai Willis, 6-5 freshman forward Kai Farlin, and freshman guard Terrion Arnold (12.6 ppg), along with 6-2 sophomore Willie Taggart Jr., the Seminoles’ returning roster has undeniable upside.“They have some young talent, and the key to anything is experience and maturation,” Ward said. “The one thing they all have to learn is talent alone doesn’t provide success. I just want to instill in them the work ethic and what they need.“Can’t take shortcuts. Give them a sense of pride being able to compete at a high level. It won’t be easy, b ut nothing in life is easy. Coach McNeil did a great job with them. I’ll just continue to build upon what he established.”",Houston Jeff Van Democrat John Thrasher Family FSU RELATED Marianna Taggart Jr Westbury Booker NFL Pat Riley Willie Taggart Seminoles Tyrone Pensacola High Christianity Florida State NEWS UNITED STATES York Knicks Greg Popovich Todd McNeil Makai Willis Charlie Ward MAN NBA Langlois roleMORE Tallahassee Anytime San Anto Van Gundy McGriff New York School Rockets

She also began to lay out what her platform will be as she prepares to face ogg against the sitting governor.'We want our government to work again. On health care, ending massive incarceration, fixing our broken subway,' said Nixon.'We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us.' Scroll down for videoEarlier this month,  NY 1 broke the news that Nixon would challenge Governor Cuomo in the Democratic primary later this year. It was also revealed that two key members behind Bill de Blasio's successful run for mayor of New York City back in 2014 will play crucial roles in Nixon's campaign.This news is not all that shocking in the wake of a piece that Nixon posted on CNN back in January ahead of President Trump's first State of the Union address.She has also been a very dedicated anbd loyal surrogate for a number of politicians, particularly Mayor de Blasio and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  In that CNN piece, Nixon wrote that just voting is not enough any more, and that a more involved role in government among those underrepresented communities was the only way t o 'take back our government.''Given the current state of the union, taking our country back is going to require all of us everyday people to step up and take action - whether by protesting anti-immigrant policies, organizing for women's rights, refusing to give polluters our business, demonstrating against police violence, or even taking the leap to run for office ourselves,' stated Nixon. 'Everyday people running means more people of color, more women, more queer people, more first-generation Americans, more allies -- more of the people whose voices have been missing for far too long.'She then added: 'We may not have million dollar super PACs behind us, but we'll have something more important - a shared mission uniting millions of people across this nation.'Nixon also hinted at the idea of a run back in August during an interview on Today.'I think there are a lot of people who would like me to run,' said Nixon. 'I think for a variety of reasons but the one number is education.'The state of New York currently ranks close to last when it comes to equitable funding among public schools, which is something that Nixon has worked to change for years.'Governor Cuomo likes to say that we spend more per pupil than any other state, and that is actually true. But the only reason that is true is because we spend so much on the kids in our wealthiest districts,' Nixon explained on that Today appearance.'Between our hundred richest schools and our hundred poorest schools there’s a $10,000 gap on what we spend per pupil.'Host Al Roker tried to get her to admit she might be eyeing a run during that segment, but Nixon refused to comment, saying:"" 'I cannot.'Nixon has been working as an actress her entire life, but shot to international fame thanks to her role as Miranda Hobbes on Sex and the City.Of the four actresses who starred on the program, it is Nixon who has enjoyed the most critical success ever since the program went off the air.She picked up an Emmy for the show's final season and another four years later for her guest turn on the popular NBC series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Nixon has also won a Best Actress Tony for her work in Rabbit Hole in 2007 and a second in the Best Supporting Actress category just last year for The Little Foxes.

The reform-oriented Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants women no head-and-face concealment and long black robes (Abaya) more prescribe. The laws of Islamic Sharia law are very clear on the issue, said the Saudi prince to the broadcaster CBS in one Sunday evening broadcast: ""Women should wear subtle and respectful clothing, as well as men."" That does not necessarily imply a black abaya or a black head wrap. ""The deciding which subtle and respectful clothing they want to wear is entirely up to the women"" It was unclear at first whether the words of the Crown Prince meant a change for the dress code in the kingdom. There are no written regulations. However, court rulings and police have long demanded a strict dress code, which includes the wearing of a traditional Abaya and in many cases the covering of face and hair. King Salman had appointed his son Mohammed in mid-2017 as crown prince and thus as his designated successor. The rise of the 32-year-old has resulted in a cautious social opening in the strictly Muslim-oriented kingdom.

United,"Germany | Bayern-Beschluss: Lewandowski darf nicht gehen | http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/719797/artikel_bayern-beschluss_lewandowski-darf-nicht-gehen.html |  At the weekend, there were again rumors about Robert Lewandowski - while the FC Bayern has long taken a clear internal decision. Going to ""Lewandowski"" appears - even before ""blond"" - the search recommendation ""Real Madrid"". No wonder: Actually for years, Robert Lewandowski is repeatedly associated with the royal, sometimes more, sometimes less concrete. The most is just hot air - and it will probably remain. The recent announcement of ""El Mundo Deportivo"", after which Lewandowski and Real had already agreed on a two-year contract, is not true for kicker information. Rather, the FC Bayern has long since taken a decision internally, that the 29-year-old center forward, who is still under contract until 2021, after this season will receive no early release. In the record champions alone is known an interest of Manchester United, but not by Real , But also the Red Devils can save their efforts: Lewandowski, who comes in 121 Bundesliga games for Bayern on 100 goals and 22 assists, may not go. The question remains whether the Bayern decision would end up with a mega offer of well over 100 million euros. The next weeks will show it.The lessons from the 1: 2 in Leipzig and why Jupp Heynckes criticized UEFA: Even more about Bayern read today in the kicker Monday issue!",Robert Lewandowski Jupp Heynckes United Real Actually SPAIN Leipzig Red Devils UEFA Bayern,"United Kingdom | The Simpsons predict Stephen Hawking's fate 19 years early | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5518033/The-Simpsons-predict-Stephen-Hawkings-fate-19-years-early.html |  It's the cartoon comedy believed to have predictedDonald Trump's presidency, the Ebola crisis and Bengt Holmström winning the Nobel Prize.Now fans believe The Simpsons may have hinted at a greater cosmological link between physicists Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, almost two decades before Hawking would die on the day that his German counterpart was born.The eerie link was uncovered this weekend as producers aired the 1999 episode - entitled They Saved Lisa's Brain - in which Hawking stars, as a tribute to his death on Wednesday 14 March.The scene features Hawking - who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 - performing in a rap called 'A Brief History Of Rhyme' - a play on his famous volume of work.With turntables fixed to his wheelchair, his animated character is also kitted out with a gold chain, which features formula made famous by Einstein, E = mc2. The reference was a direct nod to Einstein, which would become all the more pertinent 19 years on, when Hawking died on the day of Einstein's birth. 'Guess what?' one fan wrote on Twitter on Sunday night. 'The Simpsons did it again!''If you recognize the Emc^2... you know it was by Einstein who was born in March 14, WHICH is also the death of prof. Hawkings... the Simpsons did it again!' Hawking's homage to Einstein may not have initially come as a surprise to most, because they are both among the greatest physicists of all time. Yet on Wednesday, the day of Hawking's death marked 139 ye ars since the birth of Einstein - who died in 1955 at the age of 76 - and this overlap between the two gifted minds was considered quite a coincidence among science fans.Furthermore, the similarity between their birth and death dates is perhaps more pertinent than ever, owing to Hawking's belief that time is relative.There were many other spooky coincidences with the date of Stephen Hawking's death.Including the numerical date 3/14, which is significant because 3.14 are the first three digits of pi - a bedrock of geometry, and that the day was also the 300th death anniversary of Galileo Galilei.Fans were particularly touched that Hawking's episode - which originally aired in 1999 - was put back out on Sunday night in the US, to remember him. In the episode, Hawking saves Lisa from the power-hungry Springfield chapter of Mensa in a special wheelchair, complete with an Inspector Gadget–style retractable helicopter attachment and a spring-loaded boxing glove.Comments flooded in beneath the tribute from the end credits, which was posted by The Simpsons' Executive Producer Matt Sellman on Sunday and simply said 'In loving memory of Stephen Hawking'.Fans said it was 'Nicely done,' 'Awesome and class,' and ' 'A lovely moment at the end of an exceptional episode. Bravo.''Wasn't expecting this and it was nice to see,' another said, while another added. 'Amen. He will be missed'  Yet it's not the first time The Simpsons has seemingly predicted a significant event, years ahead of its ti me. The Simpsons have also eerily predicted the Arab Spring, the FIFA soccer scandal, Greece's economic crisis and the discovery of the Higgs-Boson particle.The show also showed Siegfried and Roy's tiger attack and Lady Gaga's Super Bowl performance long before they became real-life cultural events. But one of the most famous, involve The Simpsons accurately predicting the fact that then-reality TV personality Donald Trump would become president of the United StatesBack in 2000, the show made that prediction during the 'Bart to the Future' episode.Trump was later referenced in another clip called 'Trumptastic Voyage.'The iconic cartoon's creator, Matt Groening, said: 'Trump was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'Dan Greaney, a writer for the Simpsons, also told The Hollywood Reporter that the clip had a dark message behind it.He said: 'It was a warning to America. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.'It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'The cartoon foretold a Trump presidency in a surreal episode where Bart is given a window into the future - and found a country brought to its knees by financial mismanagement and a crime wave ushered in by Trump.The episode's alternate universe reveals that Trump, who will be 84 in 2030, left the country in an impossible amount of debt, and reliant on foreign aid from Europe and China.

The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets that China stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for access to its massive market.The situation remains fluid, and Trump has previously in his presidency backed off economic threats at the last minute. But he has shown a recent willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs — even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war and economists who warn such actions could ultimately hurt U.S. businesses.Trump was particularly determined to follow through on tariffs on China, as criticism of U.S.-
China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign, according to the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s plans.If implemented, the tariff package would be one of the broadest sets of economic actions imposed by a modern U.S. president agains t China and could draw retaliation, fraying the trade partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.“This looks much more like a president who is excessively eager to apply tariffs than a well-
calculated move to defend American interests,” said Phil Levy, who was a trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “There are real concerns about Chinese behavior on intellectual property, for example, but there are much more effective ways to address them.”Most U.S. businesses agree with the Trump administration’s criticisms of China. But many disagree with the administration’s strategy.“The U.S.-China Business Council believes that tariffs will do more harm than good in bringing about an improvement in intellectual property protection for American companies in China,” said John Frisbie, president of the council, a nonpartisan group of 200 U.S. companies that do business with China. “Business wants to see solutions to the issues, not just sanctions.”Other business groups endorsed the proposed tariffs. “This would be a clear indication that he’s serious about ensuring there are consequences for intellectual property violations and other ­anti-competitive practices coming from China,” said Scott Paul, president of the union-backed Alliance for American Manufacturing. “He’s not the first president who’s promised he would do something about China. But if he follows through with these tariffs, he’d be the first to ensure there are real consequences for these violations. That’s a step forward for American workers.”In 2017, China was the largest U.S. trading partner in goods
(not counting services), edging out Canada and then Mexico.
The United States exported $130.4 billion in goods to China, but it imported nearly four times as much, running a trade deficit of $375.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Economists specializing in China said that it would be difficult for the Trump administration to target Chinese companies because products imported from China are made by multinational companies with supply chains that stretch around the world.Chinese manufacturers might assemble these products or put on the finishing touches, but the country does not export as many products to the United States that are entirely made in China, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“So much of what we import from China is produced by multinational companies,” Lardy said. “Thirty percent are consumer electronics. I’m sure the president doesn’t want to raise the prices of those and send Apple’s stock into the toilet.”  It will be easier for China to hit back, Lardy said, as China can zero in on U.S. exports such as soybeans, which are entirely made in the United States. Soybeans are one of the top two goods the United States exports to China, along with aircraft and aircraft parts, according to government data.Lardy also said that penalizing China probably would not help U.S. producers, even if the tariff s succeeded in stemming the inflow of goods from China.“In the best case, they might reduce imports from China by $30 billion, but it will have virtually no effect on the U.S. global trade deficit,” he said. “We’ll just start buying things from the next lowest-cost supplier, such as Bangladesh or Vietnam. It’s not that the $30 billion will magically be produced in the United States the day after they announce these tariffs.”China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. It holds $1.17 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, down about $33.5 billion since last August. The U.S. government faces huge borrowing needs, not only to finance new deficits but also to refinance past securities now coming due, so a drop in China’s appetite for that debt could nudge interest rates up in the United States. But experts also note that China would not want to hurt the value of the huge amount of securities it still holds, leaving the two nations’ finances in a state of mutual semi-dependency.Beyond the escalating tensions with China, Trump’s pivot to protectionism has put much of the world on edge. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America first” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as the Republicans muscled tax cuts through Congress.That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.Trump earlier this month ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move U.S. allies and trading partners met with protests and threats of retaliatory tariffs. Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs and announced his resignation days before they were formally unveiled.Republican leaders in Congress criticized the metal tariffs, but the GOP is not planning legislation to overturn them. The party is also worried that Trump will withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact administration officials are renegotiating with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada.The U.S.-China Business Council noted that many states – including some swing states that propelled to an unexpected victory in 2016 – have seen sharp increases in exports to China. Over the decade ending 2016, Pennsylvania’s exports of goods to China increased 83 percent, twice the rate as its exports to the rest of the world. And Pennsylvania’s exports of services jumped more than four-fold, more than five times the pace as its services exports to the rest of the world. Exports from Michigan, another state Trump won, showed a similar pattern.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have argued China shoul d make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn’t work.Still, Trump’s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolating him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.David J.

But the technology is far from mature. In the US state of Arizona, an autonomous Uber car now hit a pedestrian. She died. The car had been sent to the street by the trucking agent Uber. According to the police, the self-driving car had been traveling in the city of Tempe, Arizona, where it had collided with a pedestrian. The 49-year-old succumbed to her injuries in the hospital. Behind the wheel of the Volvo XC90 Uber vehicle another person had been found, but the car was completely in self-drive mode, according to the police. Uber cooperates with the investigators to reconstruct the closer course. A spokeswoman for the Sino-Swedish company said autonomous driving technology is not Volvo's. The NHTSA and the NTSB Accident Investigation Bureau announced that they would send their own teams to Tempe. Company boss Dara Khosrowshahi told Twitter of ""incredibly sad news."" The San Francisco transport service broker said that all tests with self-driving cars in North America would be suspended. According to media reports, the company also wants to deduct its self-driving vehicles from the cities of Tempe, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and the Canadian Toronto.Uber tests including in Arizona self-driving cars and trucks. It is one of several dozen American U companies, including Google's subsidiary Waymo, which tests driverless driving on shared routes. Our robotic car program was burdened with problems right from the start. On the very first day of testing in San Francisco, a Uber car was filmed driving a red traffic light and over a year ago Waymo complained that Uber used stolen robotic car technology. The lawsuit was settled recently, but weighed down the Uber program. It's not the first fatal accident involving a self-drive car. Already in 2016 an accident with a Tesla had occurred. The driver of a Tesla sports car had been in Florida and had used the self-drive mode of the vehicle. In a collision at a crossroads with a truck, the driver had died. The man apparently had his hands off the wheel at the time, though Tesla had warned that their vehicles were not yet able to fully take control of the car. Vehicles like the converted Uber cars, on the other hand, are meant to work without human involvement to drive, even if at present the security drivers often intervene. California recently also allowed the operation of robotic cars with steering wheel and pedals that are controlled solely by computer or radio. Proponents of robotic cars argue that about 90 percent of traffic accidents were due to human error and technology autonomous vehicles will prevent them in the future. However, the industry also assumes that there will be fatal accidents with self-driving cars.

n ""Armageddon"", Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler only manage to destroy an asteroid at the very last second, who would destroy any life on earth on impact. Only a few days before the impact Nasa recognizes the danger and sends the drilling specialists in a hurry up into space to the space lump, so they destroy it with nuclear explosive devices. With success - but scarily scarce. The real NASA does not want to be so surprised. She has the 500-meter chunks called Bennu, which rushes to the earth with 101,000 kilometers per hour, exactly in the sights. If the 79 billion-pound asteroid hit Earth, it would have the energy of 80,000 Hiroshima bombs. It should not be that far. That's why NASA has started the project ""Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response Vehicles"", in short ""Hammer"". It is supported by the US nuclear weapons laboratory Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The ""hammer"" is to be a nine -meter-high and eight -ton heavy missile, which can be equipped with nuclear explosive devices. The plan is to send him to the asteroid to distract him from his trajectory. This is to succeed by either being used as a kind of battering ram or by detonating the nuclear explosive devices near the Brocken. He was designed to fit into a Delta IV Heavy with which he is to be shot into space. It is the world's second strongest launcher, only Elon Musk's Falcon Heavy is bigger. The sun circled on an elliptical orbit once in 1.2 years. According to very recent calculations, the asteroid of the Earth would come dangerously close on September 25, 2135. The likelihood of hitting the earth is currently 1: 2700. Even so, the asteroid, 1600 times heavier than the Titanic, is high on the Nasa list of potentially dangerous objects in space. ""The likelihood of impact seems small now, but if it did, the consequences would be dire,"" said LLNL Physicist Kirsten Howley. In addition, she says, this likelihood could change any time more data is known about Bennu. She insists on doing something. For the pressure that must act on the asteroid to distract him further, 50 years earlier could be much smaller. ""Delays are the biggest enemy of an asteroid diversion mission,"" she says. Therefore, it is important to have the right weapons for it ""on the shelf"". An early detection of the danger also seems necessary because the researchers say it takes at least seven years, from the construction of the flight, to ultimately an impulse to the Asteroid could be delivered. Then it would take another few years for the small impulse to change the trajectory. Probably not one of the missiles would be enough. The researchers calculated different scenarios: Would only ten J Ahead of a possible impact, launching a mission would require 34 to 53 missile launches to distract Bennu. If Nasa started 25 years earlier, it would only take seven to eleven launches. ""If we had only ten years left, we would have to hit Bennu with masses of hundreds of tons to distract him,"" said another LLNL physicist, Megan Bruck Syal. The researchers came to the conclusion that probably only a solution with nuclear explosions on larger objects such as Bennu leads to success. However, these should not be detonated as in ""Armageddon"" in the stone, but in the vicinity. The scientists actually refer to the film, but rather recommend the explosion at some distance. This would flood one side of the brocken with X-radiation, which in turn causes layers to evaporate on the surface of the asteroid. This would have a ""rocket-like"" boost, they say. More information about the dangerous asteroid, the researchers hope soon: In 2016, Nasa launched the mission ""Osiris-Rex"". For two years, a space probe to Bennu is on the way. She will reach the giant lump in August of this year and is to take soil samples from him using a robotic arm. With them it should become clearer, from which material exactly the asteroid exists. That would be important for his destruction as well. The return of the probe to Earth with the samples is expected in 2023.",Delays Bruck Syal Brocken IV Heavy Delta IV NASA Nasa Bruce Willis Asteroid Osiris Rex Megan Bruck BENIN Earth Affleck Liv Tyler LLNL Bennu Kirsten Howley Armageddon,"Russia | Пропавший в 2014 году Boeing «нашли» на картах Google | http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1994180/ |  Australian amateur Peter McMahon, who investigates aircraft crashes, for several years studied the images of NASA and Google Maps.

That was despite Democrats having won the state in five straight presidential elections at the time.Democrats need to win a net of 24 seats to win a majority in the U.S. House.The decision comes on the same day a federal court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Republican congressmen challenging the new map.

In January, the state Supreme Court said the congressional plan Republicans had in place since 2011 so unfairly benefited the GOP that it violated a provision in the state constitution guaranteeing free and equal elections. The suit sought to preserve that map, which gave Republicans a consistent 13-5 advantage in the state, for elections this year.The U.S. Supreme Court denied a separate but similar appeal Monday.The suit dismissed Monday was filed by Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Jacob Corman (R) and state Sen. Michael Folmer (R) as well as eight GOP Pennsylvania members of Congress. They argued that the U.S. Constitution gives the state legislature the authority to draw congressional districts and that the state Supreme Court usurped that power when it imposed its own map.But the state Supreme Court only imposed its own map after giving lawmakers and Gov. Tom Wolf (D) three weeks to come up with their own plan. In Monday’s opinion, U.S. Circuit Judge Kent Jordan and U.S. District Judges Christopher Conner and Jerome Simandle said frustration with that process was not enough for them to step in. All three judges were appointed to the bench by Republican presidents.“The Plaintiffs’ frustration with the process by which the Pen nsylvania Supreme Court implemented its own redistricting map is plain,” they wrote. “But frustration, even frustration emanating from arduous time constraints placed on the legislative process, does not accord the Plaintiffs a right to relief.”The judges went on to dismiss the suit because they said the Republicans did not have standing to challenge the state Supreme Court’s decision. Corman and Folmer, the judges wrote, are just two state senators in a 253-member state legislative body and could not have enacted a new congressional map on their own. The map put in place makes elections more competitive in Pennsylvania and gives Democrats a better chance of picking up three to four seats. The members of Congress claimed they suffered an injury under the state Supreme Court’s map because they had to divert campaign resources after the boundaries of their districts were changed. But the three-judge panel said that specific injury was unrelated to the claim that the state Supreme Court had usurped legislative authority. Precedent also strongly suggests, the judges wrote, that a lawmaker has “no legally cognizable interest in the composition of the district he or she represents.”“We hold that the federal Elections Clause violations that the Plaintiffs allege are not the Plaintiffs’ to assert,” the judges wrote. “Because fundamental principles of constitutional standing and judicial restraint prohibit us from exercising jurisdiction, we have no authority to take any action other than to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ verified complaint.”The case rejected Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court is slightly different than the one dismissed by the federal panel. The Supreme Court appeal was brought directly from the state Supreme Court’s decision by House Speaker Michael Turzai (R) and Senate President Pro Tempore Scarnati (R).U.S. Justice Samuel Alito, who is responsible for overseeing appeals from the region of the country that includes Pennsylvania, rejected a similar previous appeal from Turzai and Scarnati in February.This story has been updated with more details on the map and Monday’s U.S. Supreme court decision.Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

Hello! This is Sergey, the editor. For a long time I watched Varlamov postulate his theses about the benefits of elections in Russia, but even my patience comes to an end.

No more strength to listen to this nonsense ... Maybe we will discuss?



1. You can not go to elections

Here everything is simple. If you are against the regime, but go to the polls, then you automatically contribute to its legitimization. If you are against Putin, but go to the polls, then you are for Putin. In today's Russia, the only adequate and only visible way to state your protest is to completely ignore the electoral system.

You are aware that without throwing in will not do. You know that, perhaps, the main opposition politician in the country is not allowed before the elections on artificial grounds. On your eyes, the regime in the most fantastic ways tries to increase the turnout, so that more sheep come to the slaughterhouse from the free pastures. But you still drag yourself to the site to pay your respects to Mr. Putin.

Remember: if you urge to go to the polls without fail to ""express your opinion"", then you are a man harmful to Russia. As harmful as any system manager from EdRa.

""Go on dick, beaver collar, I'm not going to play by your rules!"" - that's what you have to say.

Here an impatient reader, a dashing quilted jacket or a ""permitted"" apple-type liberal already wants to accuse me of sympathy for Navalny, but he is disappointed. I have no sympathy for Navalny. It was once, in 2009-2010, but it all came out.

The fact is that in the talent those instantly change their shoes Navalny is like a 9th grade student, at a rush to a kiosk for beer and cigarettes, but still unable to overcome the checkpoint on duty without a change.

In December 2011, Navalny shouted into the microphone that the Kremlin can be taken even now. In August 2013, he willingly used the signatures of ""EdRa"" to run for the post of the mayor of Moscow. Now that he was not allowed to vote before the elections, Navalny immediately made a poker deal and said that the election is, it turns out, full of bullshit, and all of us were dragged bad cats by the nose!

In short, this way: I am very grateful to the UVP of the Administration of the President of Russia for instructing Mr. Navalny and his supporters on the true path. So we will win!



Those who constantly go to the polls and then beleaguered polls from polling stations should ask themselves one simple question: what good happened in the political life of Russia in the past 6 and a half years?

Well, at first, the Moscow opposition tusovka moved from ""Jean-Jacques"" to Telegram (and some also abroad). This is the main achievement, I believe. Prisoners of Marsh went out of prison. Someone received fresh grants. The site ""Mediason"" (I'm serious this time: this is really very important and very useful). Katz and Gudkov conducted a municipal campaign, and then - you will not believe it! - razosralis ... And that defended the independent mundepy Moscow trolleybus or green blocks of Khrushchev? Ah ha ha ha ha!

A significant victory, in fact, was only one - the advent of Roizma on to Ekaterinburg. But it, as I understand it, some kind of concession to the authorities personally Prokhorov, and not you. In addition, Roizman was a political freak even by the standards of the opposition.

Nemtsov was killed. The system makers of Ulyukaev and Belykh are sitting. Semisystemist Urlashov is sitting. If even one more independent mayor or governor is elected, he will be imprisoned too. How do you like this situation, dear fans of campaigns for elections? Is this an honest game, or was the bottle neck just anatomical enough?


2. Putin's interest is not an invention of the Kremlin

Yes, here I agree with Varlamov. The blatant screams of demshiz that Putin does not enjoy popular support is some kind of enchanting delirium.

When the leader, pumped up with propaganda, gives the illusion of power and greatness to a humiliated (even if supposedly humiliated) country, this always brings fruit. This was the case when Hitler was building the ideology of his state on the basis of hatred of internal and external enemies. The masses applauded him when he seized Austria and tore Czechoslovakia apart. Europe was shaking and was unable to intervene ...

Does not it look like anything?


3. Russia is ruled by grandmothers

The core of Putin's electorate is women over 45 years old. The most fat layer of those who vote for Putin is a grandmother from the age of 60. Who sit at home, do nothing, watch television, enjoy the success of the country listed in the program ""Time"", and they want you all to live in shit.

Is it possible to change this statistics or somehow draw it to your advantage? Not sure. And in general, how much Putin can a country still swallow?

Kaza The dependence should be very simple: the worse the people live, the weaker the position of the government. But this is all nonsense. The historical experience of Russia (Ivan IV, Stalin - yes anyone) and the life of some modern states (DPRK, Venezuela, African dictatorships) clearly demonstrates that peoples are subject to the Stockholm syndrome no worse than individuals. This means that Russia will accept Putin until one of the two elements disappears: either Putin or Russia. Or maybe both.

And then I turn to the last point.


4. Salvation of drowning people - not business

So, the Russians have made their choice. For the next 20 years, a noble cross between the Politburo and the State Emergency Committee will rule the country. The other day you will for sure reveal the secret of stability and continuity of the process of getting up from your knees.

But since Russia is a country of forestry, when you cut a forest, you will surely fly to a well-groomed person. And there are some points to which you will have to take your understanding:

If suddenly it turns out that the cops shoved your child into a ""bobik"", taken to the police station and tortured all night with an electric shock, do not be too surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your mother has cancer, but you can not get painkillers for her, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your uncle was summoned from the reserve and sent off to fight somewhere, and there he was cut off his head, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your sister was carried away by feminism, and her brave Cossacks whipped her for this, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly ok It seems that your dog was knocked down by a buoyant judge on his BMW, and then you had to pay for the repair of his car, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that your business was squeezed out by an ethnic organized crime group, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the Kremlin was demolished, in order to build a shopping mall and an elite 40-story LCD, instead of it, do not be surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that a park was cut down next to your house and a temple and a junction built in its place, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that there is no longer a trolley and a tram in your city, although it has always been (even in the ""dashing 90s""), do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that the road surface in your city has eroded to the mantle of the Earth, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your street was flooded with the blood of sacrificial rams, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 5,000 people were killed at the plant of your monotown, and then they closed the enterprise altogether, do not be so surprised.

If it suddenly turns out that you can not go to Turkey or Egypt, because it requires an exit visa, which is given only to spies and artists of the Bolshoi Theater, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that all the decent products from the stores have disappeared, and instead of them there is a ""plastic porridge"" on the shelves, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that you were given a hectare of land in the Far East, and then the Ministry of Defense, FSO or the FSB seized it for their own needs, do not be so surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that your cottage has collapsed full th Heptyla Proton-M rocket with another satellite, do not be very surprised.

If suddenly it turns out that 30 years have passed, and no Russia is already there, do not be very surprised.

In a statement, the Ol Pejeta Conservancy said his condition worsened and he was no longer able to stand up, so his veterinary team decided to euthanize him.Sudan was captured in Sudan in 1975, when he was just two years old, and was taken to Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic. But as that zoo fell into financial troubles and rhinos failed to breed, Sudan was relocated in 2009 to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, in Laikipia County, Kenya, along with two northern white rhino females named Najin and Fatu.The thinking was that in a place closely resembling their homeland, they would thrive. Northern white rhinos used to be found in an area spanning Uganda, Chad, southwestern Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some 2,000 existed in 1960, according to the World Wildlife Fund, but war and the poaching that funded the fighting drove them to extinction in the wild.Joseph Thaida, who took care of Sudan at the conservancy since 2012, remembers him as an affectionate and gentle rhino who had his picture taken with tourists and served as the centerpiece of publicity stunts. The most famous was when S udan got his own Tinder profile last year, to bring attention to the plight of his sub-species and direct donations to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for research on assisted reproductive technologies for rhinos.""Whenever he hears people talking, he loves to come close, because he knows he's gonna be scratched,"" Thaida told NPR last year.Thaida remembered when Sudan arrived at the conservancy, watching him as he studied the southern white rhinos already there. Sudan learned how to sharpen his horn using a tree. He began to graze and wallow in mud like his genetic cousins.After years in captivity, Sudan finally learned to become a rhino at this conservancy, Thaida believed. But he and the two females never reproduced.Dr. Steve Ngulu, the veterinarian who was in charge of Sudan, said the animal's death is sad and shocking — and a testament to human failure.""But then, as far as their propagation is concerned, we are happy that at least we collected some sperm from him and the other males,"" Ngulu said.One of the huge hurdles facing scientists is that the two remaining female northern white rhinos cannot gestate the next generation — one is sterile and the other is not physically capable of carrying a calf full term.""So, natural reproduction cannot take place, artificial insemination is not possible, so the only other option that we have to have a pure northern white rhino baby is to retrieve or to do something we call ovum pick-up, collect eggs from the females,"" Ngulu said.Those fert ilized eggs would then be implanted in a southern white rhino, who would carry the calf to term. Taking eggs from a rhino, though, has never been done. If and when scientists take that risk, there's a chance that the females could perish — bringing the species to extinction.",KENYA SOUTH AFRICA Králové Zoo SUDAN Fatu Joseph Thaida Dvůr Králové UGANDA Central Najin CZECH REPUBLIC Northern

Framed the President | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html |  MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support t hat theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.",SEYCHELLES District Columbia UNITED STATES Ms Ethics Toensing MANCHESTER Robert Clinton George diGenova Donald Bush John Dowd Mark Corallo Mueller Justice Department Jr RUSSIA Fox News Flood Trump Erik Prince Sam Clovis Columbia Joe Make Emmet Joseph Republican

Home visits from Cuyahoga County Children and Family Services and injuries documented by Aniya's daycare show a pattern of abuse dating back to 2015.On Sunday, the Euclid Fire Department found Aniya burned and unresponsive at the Cultural Garden Apartments. She was taken to the hospital where she was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed she died of blunt force trauma to the head. A follow-up visit by children and family services was scheduled for Monday.Prior to the 911 call that brought EMS to Aniya's home, children and family services had closed several cases of alleged physical abuse against Aniya, say police. The girl’s mother, Sierra Day, didn’t have a criminal record in May 2017 when a report was filed by Aniya's daycare, Harbor Crest Daycare, for ""abusing a minor."" The daycare had been documenting injuries to Aniya since 2015 at that point.News 5 sent a reporter to the daycare for comment, but it declined to do so.According to police, the daycare's incident reports concerning Aniya included: According to police, a childcare center worker said Aniya wanted to be held and hugged, and constantly asked, “Am I being good?”On May 18, 2017, Aniya was transported to Euclid Hospital when daycare staff noticed dry blood in her ear and abrasions on her head, according to a police report.At the hospital, police gave a county soc ial worker a report detailing all the incidents listed above. According to police, Aniya told the county social worker, ""Mommy hits her and hurts her.""News 5 has requested reports related to Aniya from Cuyahoga County Children and Family Services, which, days later, has yet to provide them.Children and family services were made aware of the reports of abuse, and a worker told police on March 6, 2018 the agency received a request from an ""undisclosed party"" to conduct a home visit and evaluation on Aniya.Police say that when paramedics arrived at Aniya’s home on Sunday, March 11, Aniya was in full cardiac arrest. When she was placed in the ambulance, medics told police that they saw Day and Lewis standing near the entrance of the apartment building showing ""no emotion that the child was being placed into the ambulance.”At the hospital, police noticed abuse to Aniya. She had a black swollen mark on her left eye with a laceration, causing her eye to be completely swollen shut, according to a police report.Several burn marks were on her right ankle that appeared to have blistered, popped open and dried, police said.

University,"United States | There’s Never Been a Native American Congresswoman. That Could Change in 2018. | https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html |  ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a state wide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new gene ration of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priorit y in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners , and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”",Warfare Congress Native Democrat Ms Ojibwe Minnesota Legislature Hawaii Indian Barack Obama Laguna Pueblo Health Service Trump Joe Monahan Mark Trahant Deb Haaland Republicans Healthcare National Massachusetts Sharon Clahchischilliage Albuquerque Denise Juneau Antoinette Sedillo Oklahoma MEXICO UNITED STATES Sedillo Lopez Party University Dakota Representatives Elizabeth Warren New MeToo ALBUQUERQUE House Hawaiian Peggy Flanagan Montana Andria Tupola,"United Kingdom | Child rescued from car in river | http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-43463073 |  A child has been rescued from a car in a river after a woman claimed a vehicle had been stolen with her three-year-old daughter in the back.The silver mini was found in the River Teifi in Cardigan, Ceredigion, after a two-hour police search.Dyfed-Powys Police said a child had been rescued from the vehicle and was receiving medical attention.A social media post by a woman said a car had been stolen from the Newcastle Emlyn area with her child in the back.The Wales Ambulance Service confirmed a patient has been flown to Cardiff's University of Wales Hospital in an air ambulance.Milford Haven Coastguard said a ""large multi-agency operation"" was ongoing and was being directed by Dyfed-Powys Police.A coastguard helicopter and rescue teams from the police, coastguard and RNLI searched a 200-metre (656ft) stretch of the River Teifi beneath Cardigan Castle on the eastern the side of the bridge, near the Strand.The police had said they first received a call ""as to whereabouts of a silver mini"" which had been seen last near the old Scout Hall, near the river, at about 15:30 GMT on Monday.""During a search the vehicle was located in the River Teifi, Cardigan,"" added the police statement.The condition of the rescued child is not known as large parts of Cardigan were initially closed off.The cordons were lifted at about 20:30 - apart from one lane, off the Strand, behind the Angel Hotel which is still closed and being examined by police.There are another 30 emergency services personnel inc luding police, fire and coastguard on the bank.

The package could be applied to more than 100 products, which Trump argues were developed by using trade secrets that China stole from U.S. companies or forced them to hand over in exchange for access to its massive market.The situation remains fluid, and Trump has previously in his presidency backed off economic threats at the last minute. But he has shown a recent willingness to unilaterally impose tariffs — even amid objections from advisers who fear starting a global trade war and economists who warn such actions could ultimately hurt U.S. businesses.Trump was particularly determined to follow through on tariffs on China, as criticism of U.S.-
China relations was at the center of his presidential campaign, according to the administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president’s plans.If implemented, the tariff package would be one of the broadest sets of economic actions imposed by a modern U.S. president agains t China and could draw retaliation, fraying the trade partnership between two of the world’s largest economies.“This looks much more like a president who is excessively eager to apply tariffs than a well-
calculated move to defend American interests,” said Phil Levy, who was a trade adviser to President George W. Bush. “There are real concerns about Chinese behavior on intellectual property, for example, but there are much more effective ways to address them.”Most U.S. businesses agree with the Trump administration’s criticisms of China. But many disagree with the administration’s strategy.“The U.S.-China Business Council believes that tariffs will do more harm than good in bringing about an improvement in intellectual property protection for American companies in China,” said John Frisbie, president of the council, a nonpartisan group of 200 U.S. companies that do business with China. “Business wants to see solutions to the issues, not just sanctions.”Other business groups endorsed the proposed tariffs. “This would be a clear indication that he’s serious about ensuring there are consequences for intellectual property violations and other ­anti-competitive practices coming from China,” said Scott Paul, president of the union-backed Alliance for American Manufacturing. “He’s not the first president who’s promised he would do something about China. But if he follows through with these tariffs, he’d be the first to ensure there are real consequences for these violations. That’s a step forward for American workers.”In 2017, China was the largest U.S. trading partner in goods
(not counting services), edging out Canada and then Mexico.
The United States exported $130.4 billion in goods to China, but it imported nearly four times as much, running a trade deficit of $375.2 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.Economists specializing in China said that it would be difficult for the Trump administration to target Chinese companies because products imported from China are made by multinational companies with supply chains that stretch around the world.Chinese manufacturers might assemble these products or put on the finishing touches, but the country does not export as many products to the United States that are entirely made in China, said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“So much of what we import from China is produced by multinational companies,” Lardy said. “Thirty percent are consumer electronics. I’m sure the president doesn’t want to raise the prices of those and send Apple’s stock into the toilet.”  It will be easier for China to hit back, Lardy said, as China can zero in on U.S. exports such as soybeans, which are entirely made in the United States. Soybeans are one of the top two goods the United States exports to China, along with aircraft and aircraft parts, according to government data.Lardy also said that penalizing China probably would not help U.S. producers, even if the tariff s succeeded in stemming the inflow of goods from China.“In the best case, they might reduce imports from China by $30 billion, but it will have virtually no effect on the U.S. global trade deficit,” he said. “We’ll just start buying things from the next lowest-cost supplier, such as Bangladesh or Vietnam. It’s not that the $30 billion will magically be produced in the United States the day after they announce these tariffs.”China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. It holds $1.17 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, down about $33.5 billion since last August. The U.S. government faces huge borrowing needs, not only to finance new deficits but also to refinance past securities now coming due, so a drop in China’s appetite for that debt could nudge interest rates up in the United States. But experts also note that China would not want to hurt the value of the huge amount of securities it still holds, leaving the two nations’ finances in a state of mutual semi-dependency.Beyond the escalating tensions with China, Trump’s pivot to protectionism has put much of the world on edge. His 2016 campaign was built around promises to put “America first” on every issue, but some aides managed to scale back his plans for trade restrictions in 2017 as the Republicans muscled tax cuts through Congress.That has changed this year, however, with the tax bill signed into law and some of the people who had warned against protectionism exiting the White House.Trump earlier this month ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, a move U.S. allies and trading partners met with protests and threats of retaliatory tariffs. Gary Cohn, the top White House economic adviser, opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs and announced his resignation days before they were formally unveiled.Republican leaders in Congress criticized the metal tariffs, but the GOP is not planning legislation to overturn them. The party is also worried that Trump will withdraw the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact administration officials are renegotiating with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada.The U.S.-China Business Council noted that many states – including some swing states that propelled to an unexpected victory in 2016 – have seen sharp increases in exports to China. Over the decade ending 2016, Pennsylvania’s exports of goods to China increased 83 percent, twice the rate as its exports to the rest of the world. And Pennsylvania’s exports of services jumped more than four-fold, more than five times the pace as its services exports to the rest of the world. Exports from Michigan, another state Trump won, showed a similar pattern.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday meeting with global finance ministers. The foreign officials are trying to determine whether Trump plans to follow through on his threats to engage in a “trade war.”Many of the financial ministers at the meeting have argued China shoul d make changes to its trade policies, but so far most have tried to cajole Beijing multilaterally, a strategy that Trump has said doesn’t work.Still, Trump’s approach to China has been uneven. He has tried to both befriend Chinese leader Xi Jinping while also isolating him, particularly on economic issues. On Sunday, the Treasury Department had to backtrack on an embarrassing misstep when a senior official said he had suspended economic talks with China, when a formal decision had not yet been made.David J.

She also began to lay out what her platform will be as she prepares to face ogg against the sitting governor.'We want our government to work again. On health care, ending massive incarceration, fixing our broken subway,' said Nixon.'We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us.' Scroll down for videoEarlier this month,  NY 1 broke the news that Nixon would challenge Governor Cuomo in the Democratic primary later this year. It was also revealed that two key members behind Bill de Blasio's successful run for mayor of New York City back in 2014 will play crucial roles in Nixon's campaign.This news is not all that shocking in the wake of a piece that Nixon posted on CNN back in January ahead of President Trump's first State of the Union address.She has also been a very dedicated anbd loyal surrogate for a number of politicians, particularly Mayor de Blasio and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  In that CNN piece, Nixon wrote that just voting is not enough any more, and that a more involved role in government among those underrepresented communities was the only way t o 'take back our government.''Given the current state of the union, taking our country back is going to require all of us everyday people to step up and take action - whether by protesting anti-immigrant policies, organizing for women's rights, refusing to give polluters our business, demonstrating against police violence, or even taking the leap to run for office ourselves,' stated Nixon. 'Everyday people running means more people of color, more women, more queer people, more first-generation Americans, more allies -- more of the people whose voices have been missing for far too long.'She then added: 'We may not have million dollar super PACs behind us, but we'll have something more important - a shared mission uniting millions of people across this nation.'Nixon also hinted at the idea of a run back in August during an interview on Today.'I think there are a lot of people who would like me to run,' said Nixon. 'I think for a variety of reasons but the one number is education.'The state of New York currently ranks close to last when it comes to equitable funding among public schools, which is something that Nixon has worked to change for years.'Governor Cuomo likes to say that we spend more per pupil than any other state, and that is actually true. But the only reason that is true is because we spend so much on the kids in our wealthiest districts,' Nixon explained on that Today appearance.'Between our hundred richest schools and our hundred poorest schools there’s a $10,000 gap on what we spend per pupil.'Host Al Roker tried to get her to admit she might be eyeing a run during that segment, but Nixon refused to comment, saying:"" 'I cannot.'Nixon has been working as an actress her entire life, but shot to international fame thanks to her role as Miranda Hobbes on Sex and the City.Of the four actresses who starred on the program, it is Nixon who has enjoyed the most critical success ever since the program went off the air.She picked up an Emmy for the show's final season and another four years later for her guest turn on the popular NBC series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Nixon has also won a Best Actress Tony for her work in Rabbit Hole in 2007 and a second in the Best Supporting Actress category just last year for The Little Foxes.

However, ""Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner,"" AP said.Properties with rent-controlled apartments are subject to greater oversight for construction permits and ""possibly unscheduled 'sweeps' on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave,"" the news agency reports.Bloomberg reports that while Kushner divested some of his assets when he joined the White House, his stakes in three Astoria, Queens, properties that are the focus of the AP report were not among them.""While none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States,"" according to the news agency.Current and former tenants in those buildings told the AP that they had been ""subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.""Responding to the report, Kushner Cos. said its government filings are handled by third parties subject to independent review and that ""If mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.""",Bloomberg UNITED STATES Astoria CEO Properties Cos Jared Kushner Associated Press Queens York City New York AP,"United Kingdom | Self-driving Uber car runs over and kills a pedestrian in Arizona | http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5519433/Self-driving-Uber-car-runs-kills-pedestrian-Arizona.html |  A self-driving Uber car hit and killed a pedestrian as she was crossing the road in the first fatality involving the controversial fleet of autonomous vehicles.Elaine Herzberg, 49, was hit by an SUV around 10pm on Sunday in Tempe, Arizona, when she was walking her bicycle outside of a crosswalk.She was immediately rushed to the hospital where she died from her injuries, ABC 15 reported.Tempe Police say the SUV was in autonomous mode at the time of the crash but that a vehicle operator was also behind the wheel.

University Hospital,"United States | A woman reportedly died after getting acupuncture from 'live bee stings' | https://www.sciencealert.com/a-woman-has-died-after-undergoing-bee-sting-acupuncture-apitherapy |  Who thought that was a good idea!?A 55-year old woman in Spain has died after having an allergic reaction to live bee acupuncture, and it's yet another important reminder of how alternative therapies can be extremely dangerous.If you don't know what live bee acupuncture is, we don't blame you - the process is kind of insane.""We hold the bee, put it on a point on the body, hold its head, and pinch it until the sting needle emerges,"" bee acupuncturist Wang Menglin explained in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation back in 2013.As all honey bees do, the imported Italian variety that Wang uses dies when it stings.""We've treated patients with dozens of diseases, from arthritis to cancer, all with positive results,"" he said.Most popular in China and Korea, the technique is spreading, despite very little evidence that it can help any of the diseases it says it cures.The death of the 55-year old woman has been outlined in a case study by researchers Paula Vazquez-Revuelta and Ricardo Madrigal-Burgaleta from the Ramon y Cajal University Hospital in Spain, and should be used as a warning to others trying the practice.The woman had been attending sessions of this live bee acupuncture (also called apitherapy) for two years, approximately once a month.""She decided to receive apitherapy to improve muscular contractures and stress. She had no clinical record of any other diseases, other risk factors, [or] previous reactions of any kind,"" the paper explains.""During an api therapy session, she developed wheezing, dyspnea, and sudden loss of consciousness immediately after a live bee sting.""Although it might sound crazy that she had an allergic reaction after having the procedure so many times before, it's actually more plausible than you'd expect.As the paper mentions, repeated exposure to an allergen - in this case, bee venom - creates a greater risk of a severe allergic reaction than what can be expected in the normal population.The woman was rushed to hospital, and was given a number of compounds to try to stop the reaction, including adrenaline and antihistamines.Unfortunately, despite the treatment, the patient died in hospital from multiple organ failure some weeks later.It's really important to reiterate here that although it is growing in popularity, apitherapy shows very little evidence for being effective for any medical conditions, and this isn't even the first negative reaction to this type of therapy.In fact, a 2015 study published in PLOS One found that ""compared with normal saline injection, bee venom acupuncture showed a 261 percent increased relative risk for the occurrence of adverse events.""Plus, we really need bees doing our pollination right now, not being sacrificed for alternative medicine.Vazquez-Revuelta and Madrigal-Burgaleta's paper sums up nicely: ""the risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable.""We wholeheartedly agree.The paper has been published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology.",Wang Menglin University Hospital Vazquez Revuelta ITALY Madrigal Burgaleta SPAIN Ricardo Madrigal CHINA AUSTRALIA Korea Cajal University PLOS Paula Vazquez Ramon Broadcasting,"United Kingdom | Child rescued from car in river at Cardigan dies | http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-43468076 |  A child has died after being recovered from a car found in a river after a woman said her vehicle had been taken with her daughter inside.Kiara Moore, two, died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff after being rescued from the River Teifi in Cardigan, Ceredigion, on Monday.A woman had earlier reported to police that her car had been taken with her child still in the back.Dyfed-Powys Police is investigating.The force said it had received a call about a missing vehicle at 15:30 GMT and a silver Mini was found in the river at about 17:10.In a tweet in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Dyfed-Powys Police said: ""Sadly, we confirm that Kiara Moore, aged 2 (27/3/15) was pronounced dead at the UHW, Cardiff last night, having being recovered from a car in the River Teifi, Cardigan yesterday afternoon (19th March 2018).

A mega thank you the officers who jumped in the river and the rest of the emergency services for all they did. Unfortunately Kiara had an amazing but short life.""Officers appealed for witnesses who may have seen the vehicle enter the river between 15:30 and 16:50 GMT to contact them.At present there is not information about who may have been in charge of the car before it went into the river.The police had said they had first received a call ""as to wherea bouts of a silver Mini"" which had been seen last near the old Scout Hall, near the river, at about 15:30 GMT on Monday.At the height of the search there were 30 emergency services personnel from police, fire and coastguard units in Cardigan.A search of the river continued into the evening after Kiara was found.",University Hospital Dyfed Powys Hospital Wales Cardigan Jet Cardiff UHW Kiara Moore
