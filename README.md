# TopNews-CW ðŸ’«

This is a project on analyzing international news with automatic translation and clustering. Developed for [Common World](https://common.world).

### History 

This project was started when I was in my first year at ITMO University. Then, I knew almost nothing on how to build good software and was just doing things in the way that they worked, somehow. No testing, no refactoring ðŸ˜” Thus, there is a lot of legacy code that looks awful. 

### Status

I am still developing the system. When adding new functionality, I try to write the best code I can and test it all. My attitude to programming has changed dramatically, which is good but brings me pain when I look at the legacy code I've created over 3 years that passed. However, with time I will try to refactor, optimize and cover with tests all of this code. 

I have created this table to display the current status of different modules of the system.

| Module         | Labels       | Comments                  |

### Project setup

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Create file `config.py` in the root of the project. Content of the file should be the following:<br>
`GOOGLE_API_KEY = '<YOUR_API_KEY>'`
3. Install requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run file `main.py` to parse news from Google News. The output is stored in a SQlite3 file in `db` folder.
5. Run file `wide.py` to translate and cluster the news. The output is generated as Excel files and stored in `documents` folder.
